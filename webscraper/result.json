This makes the writing more personal and engaging.\\n- Write notes: Writing notes can help improve writing skills to some extent, but might not allow for the kind of continuous practice that John needs.\\n- Write poems: This is another creative option to practice writing, but it might not be the best choice if John struggles with the basics of writing and is not yet comfortable with more advanced forms such as poetry.\\n\\nStep 3: Choose the most suitable option based on the analysis:\\nGiven the options, writing letters seems to be the best advice for John to follow when considering people he knows.

You must generate a detailed and long answer.\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?\\nOne of the first complaints presented to doctors by many people later diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face. You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses.  There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling\\&quot; movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor. Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous.  These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \\&quot;festinating gait,\\&quot; and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down.  Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD.\\n\\nSummary:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Involuntary tremors, slowed movements, and posture and balance issues are common early symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, often accompanied by disturbances in voluntary movements, speech, mood, and gastrointestinal issues as the disease progresses.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:9,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.1317837\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

The village is home to the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, which covers 6.58 square miles (17.0 km2) of land and most of the village of Briarcliff Manor and an unincorporated portion of the town of Mount Pleasant. Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District. The district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day &amp; Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978. Since then, The Clear View School has run a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21 there.

Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\&quot;a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\&quot; with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\&quot;Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\&quot; While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.\\nThe answer is:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Kennedy\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.791495\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long did it take the driver to get to his workplace?

Our expectations for Amy's upcoming album of \\&quot;jukebox stuff\\&quot; have been raised. ||||| When it was announced that the first bit of music the world would hear from Amy Winehouse after all that tabloid trouble would be a cover of Lesley Gore's \\&quot;It's My Party” for a Quincy Jones tribute album, Vulture found it just a touch uninspiring. But now the cover is actually here, and it's tough not to get carried away. Winehouse lets it fly on the Mark Ronson–produced do-over — turning in a dialed-in, muscular vocal performance that moves effortlessly from louche to anguished — and sounds not even a tiny bit horribly addicted to drugs while doing so. No word on an official Back to Black follow-up or anything, of course, but there is one other potentially positive sign: Winehouse has gone from tweeting stuff like “ronson you're dead to me; one album i write an you take half the credit — make a career out of it? don't think so BRUV” to things like “can't find me bleedin notebooks — theyve done a runsies xxxxxxxx LOVE YOU RONSON XXXXXXxxxxxxxxx.” ||||| Image Credit: Samir Hussein/Getty ImagesIf there’s something we know our beloved little wayward beehive enjoys, it’s a good party.

Authorities arrested Greek fashion publicist Phivos Lampros Istavrioglou, 29, in the case; he has pleaded not guilty, the Wall Street Journal reports. The back story: At the gallery, Istavrioglou realized the $150,000 drawing was unprotected and removed it, taking it with him back to Athens, prosecutors say. Once he arrived, prosecutors say he had second thoughts. \\&quot;When he realized the hunt was on, the defendant blinked\\&quot; and sent it back, rolling it up \\&quot;in a manner befitting a college dorm-room poster.\\&quot; Among the evidence detectives are said to have uncovered in the case: Istavriglou's fingerprint on the mailing tube, relevant Web searches made from his Google account before the story broke, and a photo of the drawing in the gallery that he posted to his Facebook page. Istavrioglou was caught after an undercover cop posed as a New York art gallery manager and offered him a job, returning him to the Big Apple. He's due back in court today, the New York Times notes.\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Title: An Unlikely Heist: The Tale of Salvador Dali Art Theft and its Intriguing Resolution\\n\\nAfter a thief casually strolled into a New York gallery, walked out with a Salvador Dali drawing, and then promptly returned the stolen art via mail, numerous observers were left puzzled. However, an explanation has emerged through the justice system. Authorities recently arrested Greek fashion publicist Phivos Lampros Istavrioglou, 29, in connection with the theft. Istavrioglou pleaded not guilty.\\n\\nThe backstory of this unusual crime starts at the New York gallery, where Istavrioglou noticed that a $150,000 Salvador Dali drawing was not properly protected. He seized the opportunity and took the drawing. He transported the artwork from New York City, to Athens, Greece, where he resides. However, upon arriving in Athens, Istavrioglou experienced a change of heart. In fear of being caught, prosecutors say Istavrioglou decided to return the precious art piece.\\n\\n\\&quot;When he realized the hunt was on, the defendant blinked,\\&quot; the prosecutor stated. In a hasty move to avoid any ramifications, Istavrioglou rolled up the Salvador Dali drawing and sent it back to the gallery. His method of rolling can be best described as \\&quot;a manner befitting a college dorm-room poster,\\&quot; reflecting a naive approach rather than a heist expert's precision.\\n\\nDetectives have managed to uncover several pieces of evidence that point to Istavrioglou's involvement in the peculiar crime. Among these pieces of evidence is his fingerprint found on the mailing tube used to return the drawing. Additional information implicating Istavrioglou includes relevant web searches made on his Google account in the period leading up to the story breaking. Furthermore, a picture of the drawing, as it hung in the gallery, was featured on Istavrioglou's Facebook profile.\\n\\nThe Greek fashion publicist was apprehended in New York City, following communication with an undercover cop who posed as an art gallery manager. The undercover officer lured Istavrioglou back to the Big Apple by offering him a lucrative job opportunity. Once in New York, officers closed in and arrested him without incident. Istavrioglou appeared in court soon after and pleaded not guilty.\\n\\nNow that the Salvador Dali drawing has been safely returned, the consequences faced by Istavrioglou remain uncertain. As a high-profile suspect in an art theft turned intriguing global case, the enigmatic nature of the criminal act and its intriguing resolution will leave many captivated and puzzled in the world of art galleries and beyond. This unusual case serves as a testament to the unpredictability of human nature, coupled with the ability for even the unlikeliest of individuals to become involved in an art heist.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:31,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.2161311\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The next day, December 26, 1991, the Council of Republics, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, issued a formal Declaration recognizing that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a state and subject of international law, and voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence (the other chamber of the Supreme Soviet, the Council of the Union, had been unable to work since December 12, 1991, when the recall of the Russian deputies left it without a quorum). The following day Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's former office, though the Russian authorities had taken over the suite two days earlier.

On the night of December 25, Mikhail Gorbachev left the Kremlin, and the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time at 7:32 p.m. Moscow time, with the Russian tricolor raised in its place. This symbolically marked the end of the Soviet Union. The following day, December 26, the Council of Republics, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, issued a Declaration recognizing that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a state and subject of international law. This vote effectively disbanded both itself and the Soviet Union. The Council of the Union, another chamber of the Supreme Soviet, had already been unable to work since December 12, due to the recall of the Russian deputies, which left it without a quorum. On December 27, Boris Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's former office, although the Russian authorities had taken control of the suite two days prior. By December 31, the remaining Soviet institutions that had not been absorbed by Russia ceased operations, and the individual republics assumed the roles of the previous central government.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:33,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.1069722\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

In the second quarter, Buffalo took the lead as kicker Rian Lindell made a 21-yard field goal.  Kansas City answered with Thigpen completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez.  Buffalo regained the lead as Lindell got a 39-yard field goal, while rookie CB Leodis McKelvin returned an interception 64 yards for a touchdown.  The Chiefs struck back with kicker Connor Barth getting a 45-yard field goal, yet the Bills continued their offensive explosion as Lindell got a 34-yard field goal, along with QB Trent Edwards getting a 15-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Buffalo continued its poundings with Edwards getting a 5-yard TD run, while Lindell got himself a 38-yard field goal.  Kansas City tried to rally as Thigpen completed a 45-yard TD pass to WR Mark Bradley, yet the Bills replied with Edwards completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Josh Reed.  In the fourth quarter, Buffalo pulled away as Edwards completed a 17-yard TD pass to TE Derek Schouman.  The Chiefs tried to come back as QB Quinn Gray completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe, yet the Bills' lead was too much for Kansas City to overcome.

I will list three of them below:\\n\\n1. Release Order:\\nThis is the order in which the films were released in theaters, starting with the Original Trilogy followed by the Prequel Trilogy and then the Sequel Trilogy. This order captures the experience of watching the films as they were introduced to the world.\\n\\n- Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)\\n- Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\\n- Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\\n- Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\\n- Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\\n- Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\\n- Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\\n- Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\\n- Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\\n\\nAdditionally, you may insert the standalone movies \\&quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\\&quot; (2016) after Episode III and \\&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story\\&quot; (2018) after Episode VIII.\\n\\n2. Chronological Order:\\nAlthough not the order in which the films were released, this option follows the timeline of the Star Wars universe.\\n\\n- Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\\n- Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\\n- Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\\n- Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)\\n- Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\\n- Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\\n- Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\\n- Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\\n- Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\\n\\n\\&quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\\&quot; takes place between Episodes III and IV, while \\&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story\\&quot; occurs between Episodes III and IV but before Rogue One.\\n\\n3.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected?  A. Because she thought the other actress did a bad job  B. Because she was treated like a liar  C. not enough information  D.

Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.  - William Walton `` Bill '' Sharman ( May 25 , 1926 -- October 25 , 2013 ) was an American professional basketball player and coach . He is mostly known for his time with the Boston Celtics in the 1950s , partnering with Bob Cousy in what some consider the greatest backcourt duo of all time . As a coach , Sharman won titles in the ABL , ABA , and NBA , and is credited with introducing the morning shootaround . He was a 10 - time NBA Champion ( having won four titles as a player with the Celtics , one as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers , and five as a Lakers executive ) , and a 12 - time World Champion in basketball overall counting his ABL and ABA titles . Sharman is also a two - time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee , having been being inducted in 1976 as a player , and in 2004 as a coach . Only John Wooden , Lenny Wilkens and Tommy Heinsohn share this double honor .  - The TD Garden (previously the Shawmut Center, the FleetCenter, and the TD Banknorth Garden; nicknamed the Boston Garden and The Garden) is a multi-purpose arena in Boston. It is named after its sponsor, TD Bank, a subsidiary of Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank.  - Robert Joseph \\&quot;Bob\\&quot; Cousy (born August 9, 1928) is an American retired professional basketball player and member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 196970 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All-American for 3 seasons.   - The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division.

The Celtics play their home games at the TD Garden, which they share with the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Boston Bruins. The franchise's 17 championships are the most of any NBA franchise, and account for 24.3 percent of all NBA championships since the league's founding in 1946. As a percentage of championships won, the Celtics are the most successful franchise to date in the major four traditional North American professional sports leagues.  - The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. They are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in association football (soccer).  - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and mounted at a height of to backboards at each end of the court.

The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true.

Remember, the premise is always true.\\n\\nIn this case, the premise is, \\&quot;A woman in white with her arms folded smiling as a man is laughing holding cotton candy.\\&quot;\\n\\n2. Understand the hypothesis: Read the provided hypothesis sentence that describes an assumption or inference about the situation based on the premise.\\n\\nIn this case, the hypothesis is, \\&quot;A woman watches her husband buying cotton candy at a carnival.\\&quot;\\n\\n3. Analyze the update: Read the update sentence that provides additional information about the situation. This update can either weaken or strengthen the hypothesis.\\n\\nIn this case, the update is, \\&quot;The woman does not know the man.\\&quot;\\n\\n4. Determine if the update is a strengthener or weakener: Assess if the update makes the hypothesis more likely to be true (strengthener) or less likely to be true (weakener) based on the relationship between the premise, hypothesis, and update.\\n\\nIn this case, the update weakens the hypothesis because the woman does not know the man, making it less likely that the man is her husband.\\n\\n5. Provide the answer: Based on your analysis, answer whether the update is a strengthener or weakener for the hypothesis. In this case, the answer is 'weakener.'\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:47,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;niv.432975\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\&quot;Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\&quot; said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\&quot;We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\&quot; he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\&quot;This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\&quot; said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of $50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. \\n\\nBased on the paragraph, does the response \\&quot;More jobs, better commute times\\&quot; correctly answer the question \\&quot;What did the president say would be two significant benefits of spending to rebuild many miles of roads, railways, and runways?\\&quot;?\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Yes, the response \\&quot;More jobs, better commute times\\&quot; correctly answers the question.

He attends Midtown Science High School, where he pines over his crush Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), while frequently getting bullied by the obnoxious Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka).At home, Peter finds a briefcase containing some of his father's old documents and learns that his father worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans) at a pharmaceutical company named Oscorp. Faking his way into the Oscorp building by pretending to be an intern, Peter sneaks into a laboratory where extremely strong \\&quot;biocable\\&quot; is being created from genetically-modified spiders. One of the spiders escapes from its container and bites Peter. On the subway ride home, Peter scuffles with a gang of thugs and discovers that he suddenly has increased agility and strength. Upon returning home, he finds the spider hiding in his jacket and stores it away.The next day, Peter goes to Dr. Connors's house and gives him Richard Parker's documents. Dr. Connors explains that he and Richard were researching cross-species genetics in order to find a way to re-grow lost limbs, Dr. Connors being motivated by the loss of his own right arm. Dr. Connors is frustrated because his superior, Dr. Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan), is pressuring him to devise a cure for Oscorp's CEO Norman Osborn, who is terminally ill.Back at school, Peter gets in trouble after accidentally breaking a basketball hoop during a game with Flash.

The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity. On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and  Bin Laden. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA. When the former  Bin Laden unit chief found out about Clarke's call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance. Imagery confirmed that less than a week after Clarke's phone call the camp was hurriedly dismantled, and the site was deserted. CIA officers, including Deputy Director for Operations Pavitt, were irate.\\&quot; Mike\\&quot; thought the dismantling of the camp erased a possible site for targeting  Bin Laden. The United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem. From 1999 through early 2001, the United States, and President Clinton personally, pressed the UAE, one of the Taliban's only travel and financial outlets to the outside world, to break off its ties and enforce sanctions, especially those relating to flights to and from Afghanistan. These efforts achieved little before 9/11. In July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over  Bin Laden. The Taliban did not take him seriously, however. Bin Zayid later told an American diplomat that the UAE valued its relations with the Taliban because the Afghan radicals offered a counterbalance to \\&quot;Iranian dangers\\&quot; in the region, but he also noted that the UAE did not want to upset the United States. \\n\\nQuestion: \\&quot;Why did Hamdan bin Zayid's threat to break relations with the Taliban achieve little results before 9/11?\\&quot;\\n\\nResponse: \\&quot;UAE\\&quot;\\nAvailable choices:\\n(a). no\\n(b). yes\\nDoes the response correctly answer the question?\\n\\n\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;The provided response \\&quot;UAE\\&quot; does not correctly answer the question.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. “When we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements. Pompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements. The secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program.

This fact is on the surface unrelated to greenhouse gases production. However, if we consider that the spread of diseases among animals could potentially affect agricultural activities (such as livestock farming), which contribute to the production of greenhouse gases, we might find an indirect connection.\\n\\nFor instance, if more animals become sick and die or need to be culled to prevent the spread of disease, the demand for alternative sources of food might increase. Depending on these alternative sources (e.g., increased land use for crops or an increase in demand for fossil fuels for transportation), the production of greenhouse gases could either increase (more effect) or decrease (less effect) as a consequence of this perturbation.\\n\\nHowever, without more information on the specific alternative sources of food and their greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to determine the extent of the influence on the second effect mentioned (temperature continues to rise and melts the polar ice caps).\\n\\nTherefore, based on the given information, I would conclude that the supposed perturbation of an animal coming into contact with more sick animals has an uncertain effect on temperature rise and the melting of polar ice caps.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:63,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.450764\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

The victims are often women and their children and they frequently have few resources with which to pursue their legal rights,\\&quot; Trout said Tuesday. \\&quot;This campaign helps fill that gap in legal services for women who need the help at a time when they are in crisis.\\&quot; The Idaho Partners for Justice Project has already secured pledges of more than $35,000 from law firms, attorneys, corporations and individuals. The goal is $100,000. The drive to pay for free legal services will continue for the next two months. The money goes to Idaho Legal Aid Services and the Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program. Last year, more than 5,000 petitions were filed in Idaho for protection orders in domestic violence cases. More than 12,000 victims contacted shelters or crisis hotlines. Joining Trout in the announcement was Idaho Bar Association President Fred Hoopes of Idaho Falls and Ida-West Energy Co. Chief Executive Officer Randy Hill, members of the project's executive committee. Also on hand were some women who were victims of such violence, but benefited from free legal services.

Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  I am facing a new situation today: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations.

No information is provided about potential sources of contamination near Lake Tresco.\\n\\nStep 2: Locate the sources near the lakes.\\nLake Mahoe is situated right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops. This implies that fertilizers and pesticides are likely applied.\\n\\nStep 3: Consider chemical runoff.\\nRainwater can pick up chemicals from the farm fields and carry them into the lake, causing contamination. There is no mention of any similar process occurring near Lake Tresco.\\n\\nStep 4: Consider the effects of these chemicals.\\nThe absorbed fertilizer can enhance the growth of water plants and algae, sometimes to detrimental levels, leading to dead zones where nothing can live. Some of the chemicals can also seep into groundwater and contaminate wells from where people draw drinking water.\\n\\nStep 5: Conclude based on evidence.\\nGiven the background knowledge and the specific situation, it is much more probable that Lake Mahoe is exposed to higher levels of chemical contaminants from the nearby farm when compared to Lake Tresco, which doesn't have an identified source of similar contamination close by.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:68,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.399380\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

Disraeli's expansionist foreign policy, which Victoria endorsed, led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. \\&quot;If we are to maintain our position as a first-rate Power\\&quot;, she wrote, \\&quot;we must ... be Prepared for attacks and wars, somewhere or other, CONTINUALLY.\\&quot; Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign, protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers: \\&quot;It is not in our custom to annexe countries\\&quot;, she said, \\&quot;unless we are obliged &amp; forced to do so.\\&quot; To Victoria's dismay, Disraeli lost the 1880 general election, and Gladstone returned as prime minister. When Disraeli died the following year, she was blinded by \\&quot;fast falling tears\\&quot;, and erected a memorial tablet \\&quot;placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend, Victoria R.I.\\&quot;\\nWhat position did Victoria take on how to be a successful and top notch power?\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Queen Victoria took a firm stance on the importance of maintaining and expanding the British Empire in order to secure its position as a top-notch, first-rate power during her reign. She believed that this could be achieved through a combination of aggressive foreign policy, military preparedness, and a sense of humanitarian responsibility towards the native populations under British rule.\\n\\nVictoria had a strong alliance with her Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, who shared her expansionist views. Together, they pushed for British involvement in global conflicts, such as the Russo-Turkish War, the Anglo-Zulu War, and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. It is crucial to note that during the Russo-Turkish War, Queen Victoria pressured Disraeli to act against Russia and even threatened to abdicate five times, showcasing her unwavering determination to assert British interests.\\n\\nIn her opinion, to maintain Britain's position as a leading power, the country had to be ready for conflicts and wars continually. This militaristic outlook aligned well with the era's prevailing attitude of the \\&quot;civilizing mission,\\&quot; wherein imperialist nations believed it was their duty to bring progress and enlightenment to the territories they colonized.\\n\\nFurthermore, Queen Victoria emphasized the protective nature of the British Empire's expansion. She argued that it served as a benign and civilizing force, shielding native populations from aggressive powers or cruel rulers. In this sense, she did not see the annexation of countries as an inherently negative practice but rather as a necessary measure if circumstances demanded it. She claimed that Britain would only annex countries if they were \\&quot;obliged and forced to do so.\\&quot;\\n\\nHowever, her close relationship with Disraeli meant she was not always in step with the broader political context. Victoria was deeply dismayed when he lost the 1880 general election to William Gladstone and later died. In memory of their shared vision for imperial Britain, Queen Victoria erected a memorial tablet in Disraeli's honor.\\n\\nIn summary, Queen Victoria's position for ensuring Britain's success as a top-notch power involved a combination of aggressive and expansionist foreign policy, military preparedness, protection for native populations, and a sense of moral obligation to bring about progress and enlightenment. This approach was firmly tied to the colonial and imperialist attitudes of the 19th century, but it reinforces the importance she placed on asserting Britain's power and influence on the global stage.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:69,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;cot.43857\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.

An insulted Gloria, whose dress is torn, takes Liggett's wife Emily's (Dina Merrill) mink coat to cover herself and scrawls \\&quot;No Sale\\&quot; in lipstick on the mirror, but she orders her telephone answering service, BUtterfield 8, to put Liggett through if he calls. Gloria visits a childhood friend, pianist Steve Carpenter, who chastises her for wasting her life on one-night stands but agrees to ask his girlfriend Norma to lend her a dress. Gloria leaves, and Norma tells Steve to choose between her and Gloria. Liggett takes a train to the countryside where his wife Emily is caring for her mother. A friend, Bingham Smith, advises him to end his adulterous relationships and return to Bing's law firm instead of working for the chemical business of Emily's father. Meanwhile, Gloria lies to her mother Annie, claiming to have spent the night at Norma's. Liggett returns home. Finding the lipstick and money, he phones Gloria to explain the money was meant for her to buy a new dress, to replace the one that he had torn. While drinking later that night, Liggett advises her to ask a high price for her lovemaking talents. She insists she does not take payment from her dates and claims she has been hired as a model to advertise the dress she is wearing at three bistros that night. Liggett follows Gloria, watching her flirt with dozens of men at several clubs. He then drives her to a run-down motel. After sleeping together, Liggett and Gloria decide to explore their relationship further. Together for five days, they grow closer, falling genuinely in love with one another and parting only upon the return of Liggett's wife., can you guess it ?\\nAnswer:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;The full name of the man who works for a chemical business in the provided article is Weston Liggett.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:71,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.796480\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

Some examples of objects that may work are a small book, an eraser, or a small, flat object with some heft.\\n\\nStep 3: Clean the object\\nBefore placing the object on the keyboard, clean it so it doesn't leave any dirt or debris on the keys.\\n\\nStep 4: Position the object carefully\\nCarefully place the object exactly over the key that needs to be held down. Make sure that it only presses the desired key and doesn't accidentally press any of the adjacent keys.\\n\\nStep 5: Test the result\\nOnce the object is placed correctly over the key, check to see if the key is being held down successfully. If it's not pressed down enough or it's pressing other keys, reposition the object accordingly.\\n\\nStep 6: Monitoring the situation\\nPeriodically check on the setup to ensure the keyboard is functioning correctly and that the object hasn't moved or fallen off.\\n\\nIn these steps, I have successfully managed to hold down a keyboard note without using my hands by utilizing a suitable object as a substitute to apply weight on the key.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:72,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.1848382\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?\\nA:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Yes, the perturbation hypothesis does have an indirect effect on the process. If more conservation occurs, it means that there will be increased efforts to protect and preserve natural resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity. This can lead to greater awareness and implementation of sustainable practices such as reforestation, limiting deforestation, reducing the use of fossil fuels, and promoting alternative energy sources.\\n\\nAs a result, the process would be affected in the following ways:\\n- Reduced deforestation means more trees to help absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate climate change.\\n- Promotion of alternative energy sources can help reduce dependency on fossil fuels, leading to less burning and release of carbon dioxide.\\n- Reforestation efforts can help increase the overall number of trees on the planet, which will absorb more carbon dioxide and release oxygen, contributing to a more stabilized atmosphere.\\n\\nIn conclusion, increased conservation efforts can have an indirect effect on the process by mitigating some of the negative consequences of human activities on the environment, such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. These actions can help contribute to slowing down and potentially reversing climate change and its impact on the earth's short-term weather patterns and long-term climate patterns.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:74,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.867003\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plan ahead, and build your knowledge base about the topics you’re studying for work or school. Additionally, get all of your assignments finished before they’re due. Keep a planner or use the calendar in your phone to help yourself stay on top of things. Maintain good posture by standing up straight and pressing your shoulders back. Smile, keep your arms at your sides, and look at your surroundings. When you talk to people, focus on your talents and achievements, not your flaws. If you want to increase your confidence, do something small every day that makes you feel accomplished. You can also do more things you enjoy and take calculated risks. For example, you might try out for a sports team, enter an art show, or volunteer to take the lead on a project. Punctuality is essential if you want to appear serious and professional. Always be on time or early for things. Set an alarm or calendar entry on your phone to help you remember when you need to be places. Everyone encounters obstacles at one time or another. If you’re going to be late due to an emergency or unforeseen event, call ahead and let people know. Say exactly what you mean, and ask for what you need. Always be kind and respectful when you provide feedback, but don’t be vague because you think it will spare someone’s feelings. Additionally, don’t say more than you need to say.  Don’t expect people to guess what you’re thinking. If it’s important, just tell them. Let's say you're working on a group project and think one person is holding up your progress. You might say, \\&quot;Our group project is coming along, but I'm worried you aren't going to be finished with your part on time. Can you get it finished by tomorrow?\\&quot; Avoid meaningless chatter, as talking too much can make people see you as unprofessional. Additionally, speaking less often will make your words carry more impact. Keep it professional by only sharing your best thoughts and ideas. For example, don’t add to workplace gossip or chat about topics like TV shows and sports. However, do speak up when you know the answer to a question or when you have a great idea to share. Appearing to be unsure can make you look unprofessional or flaky. At the same time, you’re not going to have all of the answers. To protect your image, respond positively but buy yourself some time to think about what you’ll do or say next. You might say, “That’s a really great point. I’m going to think that over today and get back to you tomorrow with my response,” or “I appreciate your feedback. It’s given me a lot to think about.” Talking about your personal life too often or at the wrong times can make you look less professional. At the same time, talking about your life may help you bond with others. Choose the right times to share personal details about yourself, such as during lunch, breaks, and post-work or after-school events. During work hours or class, stick to topics related to work or school, as well as current events. Similarly, don’t gossip about others’ personal lives. People may perceive you as immature and unprofessional. If your friends or coworkers are gossiping, change the subject. You might say, “All I’m thinking about right now is our project that’s due next week. Have any of you started?” Do what you say you’ll do, when you say you’ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten. If you don’t follow through, people won’t respect you because they’ll perceive you as being immature and unprofessional.\\n\\nWhat is a summary?\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;A summary of the article entails the importance of appearing professional, maintaining productivity, and building confidence to succeed in work or school environments.

The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides $1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the $25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The Perijá tapaculo is a small bird, 10 to 12 cm (3.9 to 4.7 in) in length with an average mass of 17 to 18 grams (around 0.6 oz). The bill averages 6.8 millimetres (0.27 inches) long, 2.9 mm (0.11 in) wide, and 3.5 mm (0.14 in) high. The legs are about 21 mm (0.83 in) long. The Perijá tapaculo's tarsus averages 21.1 millimetres (0.83 in) long. The wings measure 57.4 mm (2.26 in) on average and the tail is about 40 mm (1.6 in) long with between 8 and 12 rectrices.The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and scapular area are a neutral grey colour. There is a brown spot on the nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and the bottom of their breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.The bird's plumage colouration is most similar to the pale-bellied tapaculo. The S. g. morenoi subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo can be differentiated from the Perijá tapaculo by its entirely brown back and nape, and its different calls. Juveniles of this subspecies have a dull ventral plumage, while the Perijá tapaculo has a more yellow plumage. It also resembles the Caracas tapaculo but has a duller ventral colour.\\nA:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Male specimens of the Perijá tapaculo have brown on the back of their legs and whitish on the front.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:85,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.924160\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: You're Next Movie plot: The film opens with a couple being murdered in their house by assailants wearing various animal masks. Erin accompanies her boyfriend Crispian Davison to his family reunion at their rural Missouri vacation home, adjacent to the property of the murdered couple. Present are Crispian's parents Aubrey and Paul, his older brother Drake and Drake's wife Kelly, his younger siblings Felix and Aimee, Felix's girlfriend Zee, and Aimee's boyfriend Tariq. During an argument at the dinner table between Drake and Crispian, Tariq and Drake are shot by crossbow bolts from outside the house, Tariq fatally and Drake moderately wounded. With their cell phone signals jammed by the attackers, Aimee runs out the front door to get help, but runs into a garrote wire which slashes her throat. Crispian leaves the house to find help. Aubrey is brought upstairs to her bedroom by Paul; when Paul leaves the room, Fox Mask appears from under the bed and kills Aubrey. The rest of the family rushes upstairs to find Aubrey dead with the words \\&quot;You're next\\&quot; scrawled on the wall in blood. Erin begins securing the house and texts 911. She encounters Tiger Mask and evades his attack, wounding him in the process. Kelly returns to the bedroom and discovers Fox Mask still hiding under the bed. She panics and runs to the neighboring home. After pounding on the window for help, she gets inside but discovers the murdered couple and is soon killed by a maul-wielding Lamb Mask. Back at the house, Tiger Mask once again fails to murder Erin and is in turn killed by her with a meat tenderizer; it is later revealed that Tiger Mask is actually Lamb Mask's brother. Lamb Mask finds Drake, but Erin stabs him with a screwdriver and he retreats. While exploring the house, Paul finds evidence that the killers had been staying in the house for a while. He tries to tell Zee and Felix, but Fox Mask appears from behind and slashes his throat. It is revealed that Felix and Zee hired the assassins to murder the family and collect their inheritance.

Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel Edouard Brémond was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui . Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, also played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army. The British government in Egypt sent a young officer, Captain T. E. Lawrence, to work with the Hashemite forces in the Hejaz in October 1916. The British historian David Murphy wrote that though Lawrence was just one out of many British and French officers serving in Arabia, historians often write as though it was Lawrence alone who represented the Allied cause in Arabia. David Hogarth credited Gertrude Bell for much of the success of the Arab Revolt. She had travelled extensively in the Middle East since 1888, after graduating from Oxford with a First in Modern History. Bell had met Sheikh Harb of the Howeitat in January 1914 and thus was able to provide a \\&quot;mass of information\\&quot; which was crucial to the success of Lawrence's occupation of Aqaba covering the \\&quot;tribal elements ranging between the Hejaz Railway and the Nefud, particularly about the Howeitat group.\\&quot; It was this information, Hogarth emphasized, which \\&quot;Lawrence, relying on her reports, made signal use of in the Arab campaigns of 1917 and 1918.\\&quot;\\n\\nAnswer this question based on the article: Which army had more Mulim officer, the English or the French?\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Based on the article, the French army had more Muslim officers than the English army during the Arab Revolt in the Hejaz.

While these elements are commonly associated with Chinese New Year celebrations, we cannot conclusively determine that the people are celebrating Chinese New Year for several reasons:\\n\\n1. Chinese dragon costumes and red lanterns are symbolic representations used during various cultural and traditional events in China, not just Chinese New Year. For example, they may appear in Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations, weddings, or even business openings.\\n\\n2. The Chinese dragon costume could be part of a performance or dance that is not explicitly related to Chinese New Year. The dragon dance, for instance, is performed in several other occasions to bring good fortune and chase away evil spirits. Similarly, red lanterns are considered a symbol of happiness and prosperity and can be used as decorations throughout the year.\\n\\n3. The context of the event or location isn't provided. For example, the scenario could take place at a multicultural festival or a theme park, where costumes and decorations from various cultures are showcased regardless of the time of year.\\n\\n4. Even if the event seems to include elements that are traditionally associated with Chinese New Year, the people might still be part of a cultural performance or using the decorations for other purposes, such as an art exhibition, photoshoot, or a stage play.\\n\\nIn summary, while the scenario described provides certain hints towards Chinese New Year celebration, we cannot decisively conclude that the people are celebrating it without additional information or context.

This increase in her workload could lead to stress, both physical and emotional. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\n1. Asthma: Asthma is generally not caused by stress. It is a chronic lung disease and results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While stress can potentially trigger asthma symptoms in some cases, it is not a direct consequence of the given situation.\\n\\n2. More: It seems this option is incomplete or unclear. Without any context, we cannot determine what \\&quot;more\\&quot; may refer to.\\n\\n3. Boredom: Boredom would be unlikely in this situation, as the wife is dealing with a heavier workload and increased responsibilities. This would leave her with little time to feel bored, as most of her time would be occupied with housework and childcare.\\n\\n4. Headache: Stress can indeed lead to headaches, which can be caused by tension, muscle strain, or hormonal changes. In the given situation, the wife's increased stress and workload may contribute to the development of headaches.\\n\\n5. Arguments: The imbalance in shared responsibilities between Randy and his wife could likely lead to arguments and tension in their relationship. The wife may feel overwhelmed and resentful due to the unfair distribution of housework, leading to disagreements and strife in the family.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the most plausible outcomes of Randy not doing housework while his wife raises two children are headaches and arguments. These issues could arise from the increased stress, tension, and the unfair division of labor within their household.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:95,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;t0.743414\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

Mrs. Johnson’s class raised $2300, which is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton’s class raised. Mrs. Sutton’s class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin’s class. Miss Rollin’s class raised a third of the total amount raised by the school. How much money did the school raise for the playground if 2% will be deducted for administration fees?.\\nMe: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Step 1: Find out how much Mrs. Sutton's class raised. Since Mrs. Johnson's class raised $2300, and that is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton's class raised, we can divide $2300 by 2 to find the amount Mrs. Sutton's class raised:\\n2300 ÷ 2 = $1150\\n\\nStep 2: Find out how much Miss Rollin's class raised. Since Mrs. Sutton's class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin's class, we can multiply the amount Mrs. Sutton's class raised by 8 to find the amount Miss Rollin's class raised:\\n1150 × 8 = $9200\\n\\nStep 3: Find the total amount raised by the school before deducting the administration fees. Since Miss Rollin's class raised a third of the total amount, we can multiply the amount Miss Rollin's class raised by 3 to find the total amount raised by the school before deducting the fees:\\n9200 × 3 = $27,600\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate the amount of administration fees that need to be deducted. Since 2% of the total amount raised will be deducted for administration fees, we multiply the total amount by 0.02 (2% as a decimal):\\n27,600 × 0.02 = $552\\n\\nStep 5: Subtract the administration fees from the total amount raised to find the final amount raised for the playground:\\n27,600 - 552 = $27,048\\n\\nSo, Tree Elementary School raised a total of $27,048 for the new playground after deducting the 2% administration fees.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:98,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.1551633\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

They're funnier and better than every other movie combined. They might as well have stopped making movies after \\&quot;Cannonball Run 2\\&quot;, but I guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones? Man this movie's good. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the luxuriant Loni Anderson is on hand, looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure loved that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I laughed so hard I almost passed away into the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then never watch another movie again, because I tell you right now: there's no point.\\n\\nDid this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?\\npick from the following. +negative. +positive....I think the answer is\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;+positive.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:99,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.2108115\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?\\nYou could go directly into the confessional (provided there's no one else in there or waiting outside), but sometimes it's nice to take a minute in the pew by yourself beforehand. You have this beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through you? Can you feel the majesty of the Lord's kingdom and how you're a part of it? Take a moment to kneel and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith and how you feel currently. Think about how you've been responding to God's call and how you've been living in the light of his love. When the priest is ready for you, of course. You'll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it's totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous. He won't treat you any differently either way. Make the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, \\&quot;Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It has been (blank) since my last confession.\\&quot; This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that's fine, too. The priest knows what he's doing. The Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you. Once you sit down and you've made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest's lead. He'll ask you how long it's been since your last confession (if you don't voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. It's just a casual conversation! Do not fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you're more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession! This part is intimidating, but think about it this way: the priest you're talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, \\&quot;I did so and so,\\&quot; will suffice. Your priest is going to be very understanding. If you don't remember the exact timeframe, that's fine. If you don't remember your motivation, that's fine. All your priest cares about is that you're being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place. He'll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, sin and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He's there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this:  My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,I have sinned against You whom I should loveabove all things. I firmly intend, with your help,to do penance, to sin no more, andto avoid whatever leads me to sin.Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.In his name, my God, have mercy  (If you are a Roman Catholic, your act of contrition will go like this: Oh my God, I am very sorry for having offended thee. I detest all of my sins because of thy just punishment. But most of all, because they offend you, my God, who is all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace, to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen. Don't worry! It won't be anything huge. You may even walk away just having to say a few meaningful prayers. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, clean slate to work with. It'll feel so uplifting! Just to clarify, \\&quot;absolution\\&quot; means your sins are washed away. \\&quot;Penance\\&quot; is your expression of regret and repentance, showing God that you're truly sorry for what you've done and that you wish for nothing more than to be forgiven.\\n\\nSummary:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;The article provides guidance on the process of confession in a church, emphasizing the importance of reflection, honest conversation with the priest, and the act of contrition for a meaningful and pressure-free experience, ultimately leading to absolution and spiritual growth.\\&quot;&quot;}}}],&quot;columns&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;id&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;depends on text direction&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;id (string)&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;system_prompt&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;depends on text direction&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;system_prompt (string)&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;question&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;depends on text direction&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;question (string)&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;response&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;depends on text direction&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;response (string)&quot;}],&quot;truncated&quot;:false,&quot;basePath&quot;:&quot;/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca/viewer/default/train&quot;}\" data-target=\"DatasetViewerTable\"><div class=\" relative overflow-auto border-t\"><table class=\"w-full table-auto rounded-lg font-mono text-xs text-gray-900\"><thead class=\"sticky top-0 left-0 right-0 z-10 bg-white shadow-sm\"><tr class=\"space-y-54 divide-x border-b text-left\"><th class=\"max-w-sm p-2 text-left\">id (string)</th><th class=\"max-w-sm p-2 text-left\">system_prompt (string)</th><th class=\"max-w-sm p-2 text-left\">question (string)</th><th class=\"max-w-sm p-2 text-left\">response (string)</th></tr></thead> <tbody class=\"h-16 overflow-scroll\"><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"0\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"niv.242684\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.\nThis task is about using the specified sentence and converting the sentence to Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplets of the form (subject, predicate object).

You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses.  There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling\" movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor. Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous.  These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \"festinating gait,\" and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down.  Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD.\n\nSummary:\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Involuntary tremors, slowed movements, and posture and balance issues are common early symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, often accompanied by disturbances in voluntary movements, speech, mood, and gastrointestinal issues as the disease progresses.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"9\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.1317837\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

The only downside mentioned by the reviewer is the unavailability of the movie on DVD, but this does not detract from their overall positive experience.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"17\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"cot.57163\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.

Context: Heliocentrism is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System. Historically, Heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BCE by Aristarchus of Samos, but at least in the medieval world, Aristarchus's Heliocentrism attracted little attention -- possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era.\n\nQuestion: who said sun is the center of the solar system?\nAnswer.

This historical context is important to understand the significance of heliocentrism and the person who proposed it.\n\nStep 3: Identify key figures related to the heliocentric model.\nThe question asks for the individual who initially proposed the Sun as the center of the solar system. Aristarchus of Samos is mentioned as the person who proposed this model as early as the 3rd century BCE.\n\nStep 4: Verify the credibility of the claim.\nThe text mentions that Aristarchus's heliocentrism attracted little attention at the time possibly due to the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era, implying that his proposal was indeed an early instance of heliocentrism.\n\nStep 5: Combine the findings to form the answer.\nBased on the historical context, the opposing views, and the identification of Aristarchus of Samos as the individual who proposed the Sun as the center of the solar system, the answer to the question \"who said the Sun is the center of the solar system?\" is Aristarchus of Samos.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"18\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"t0.1164694\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The village is home to the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, which covers 6.58 square miles (17.0 km2) of land and most of the village of Briarcliff Manor and an unincorporated portion of the town of Mount Pleasant. Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District. The district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day &amp; Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978. Since then, The Clear View School has run a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21 there. The Macfadden School ran from 1939 to 1950 at the William Kingsland mansion in the village.\nAnswer:\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Briarcliff High School is part of the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"19\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"t0.4801\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose biography was Michael Kennedy?  Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.\nThe answer is:\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Kennedy\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"20\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.791495\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Our expectations for Amy's upcoming album of \"jukebox stuff\" have been raised. ||||| When it was announced that the first bit of music the world would hear from Amy Winehouse after all that tabloid trouble would be a cover of Lesley Gore's \"It's My Party” for a Quincy Jones tribute album, Vulture found it just a touch uninspiring. But now the cover is actually here, and it's tough not to get carried away. Winehouse lets it fly on the Mark Ronson–produced do-over — turning in a dialed-in, muscular vocal performance that moves effortlessly from louche to anguished — and sounds not even a tiny bit horribly addicted to drugs while doing so. No word on an official Back to Black follow-up or anything, of course, but there is one other potentially positive sign: Winehouse has gone from tweeting stuff like “ronson you're dead to me; one album i write an you take half the credit — make a career out of it? don't think so BRUV” to things like “can't find me bleedin notebooks — theyve done a runsies xxxxxxxx LOVE YOU RONSON XXXXXXxxxxxxxxx.” ||||| Image Credit: Samir Hussein/Getty ImagesIf there’s something we know our beloved little wayward beehive enjoys, it’s a good party. And apparently, this one ends in tears. \n  \n The 27-year-old Grammy winner returned to the studio recently for the star-strewn Quincy Jones release Q: Soul Bossa Nostra, due November 9, with her Back to Black producer (and recent subject of a Wino tweet-spanking) Mark Ronson. \n  \n You can hear their recording of Lesley Gore’s 1963 teenage cri de coeur “It’s My Party” \n  \n over at NYmag.com (via Soundcloud). The RonHouse pairing proves as Spector-esquely fruitful as ever—though frankly, whether the reasons are stylistic or substance-related, Amy’s penchant for slurring her vocals yields something closer to “Ish My Parrry.” \n  \n What do you think?

However, an explanation has emerged through the justice system. Authorities recently arrested Greek fashion publicist Phivos Lampros Istavrioglou, 29, in connection with the theft. Istavrioglou pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe backstory of this unusual crime starts at the New York gallery, where Istavrioglou noticed that a $150,000 Salvador Dali drawing was not properly protected. He seized the opportunity and took the drawing. He transported the artwork from New York City, to Athens, Greece, where he resides. However, upon arriving in Athens, Istavrioglou experienced a change of heart. In fear of being caught, prosecutors say Istavrioglou decided to return the precious art piece.\n\n\"When he realized the hunt was on, the defendant blinked,\" the prosecutor stated. In a hasty move to avoid any ramifications, Istavrioglou rolled up the Salvador Dali drawing and sent it back to the gallery. His method of rolling can be best described as \"a manner befitting a college dorm-room poster,\" reflecting a naive approach rather than a heist expert's precision.\n\nDetectives have managed to uncover several pieces of evidence that point to Istavrioglou's involvement in the peculiar crime. Among these pieces of evidence is his fingerprint found on the mailing tube used to return the drawing. Additional information implicating Istavrioglou includes relevant web searches made on his Google account in the period leading up to the story breaking. Furthermore, a picture of the drawing, as it hung in the gallery, was featured on Istavrioglou's Facebook profile.\n\nThe Greek fashion publicist was apprehended in New York City, following communication with an undercover cop who posed as an art gallery manager. The undercover officer lured Istavrioglou back to the Big Apple by offering him a lucrative job opportunity. Once in New York, officers closed in and arrested him without incident. Istavrioglou appeared in court soon after and pleaded not guilty.\n\nNow that the Salvador Dali drawing has been safely returned, the consequences faced by Istavrioglou remain uncertain. As a high-profile suspect in an art theft turned intriguing global case, the enigmatic nature of the criminal act and its intriguing resolution will leave many captivated and puzzled in the world of art galleries and beyond. This unusual case serves as a testament to the unpredictability of human nature, coupled with the ability for even the unlikeliest of individuals to become involved in an art heist.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"31\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.2161311\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the night of December 25, Mikhail Gorbachev left the Kremlin, and the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time at 7:32 p.m. Moscow time, with the Russian tricolor raised in its place. This symbolically marked the end of the Soviet Union. The following day, December 26, the Council of Republics, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, issued a Declaration recognizing that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a state and subject of international law.

In the first quarter, Buffalo trailed early as Chiefs QB Tyler Thigpen completed a 36-yard TD pass to RB Jamaal Charles.  The Bills responded with RB Marshawn Lynch getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Buffalo took the lead as kicker Rian Lindell made a 21-yard field goal.  Kansas City answered with Thigpen completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez.  Buffalo regained the lead as Lindell got a 39-yard field goal, while rookie CB Leodis McKelvin returned an interception 64 yards for a touchdown.  The Chiefs struck back with kicker Connor Barth getting a 45-yard field goal, yet the Bills continued their offensive explosion as Lindell got a 34-yard field goal, along with QB Trent Edwards getting a 15-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Buffalo continued its poundings with Edwards getting a 5-yard TD run, while Lindell got himself a 38-yard field goal.  Kansas City tried to rally as Thigpen completed a 45-yard TD pass to WR Mark Bradley, yet the Bills replied with Edwards completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Josh Reed.  In the fourth quarter, Buffalo pulled away as Edwards completed a 17-yard TD pass to TE Derek Schouman.  The Chiefs tried to come back as QB Quinn Gray completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe, yet the Bills' lead was too much for Kansas City to overcome.

I will list three of them below:\n\n1. Release Order:\nThis is the order in which the films were released in theaters, starting with the Original Trilogy followed by the Prequel Trilogy and then the Sequel Trilogy. This order captures the experience of watching the films as they were introduced to the world.\n\n- Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n- Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n- Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n- Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n- Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n- Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n- Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\n- Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\n- Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\nAdditionally, you may insert the standalone movies \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" (2016) after Episode III and \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" (2018) after Episode VIII.\n\n2. Chronological Order:\nAlthough not the order in which the films were released, this option follows the timeline of the Star Wars universe.\n\n- Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n- Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n- Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n- Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n- Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n- Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n- Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\n- Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\n- Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\n\"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" takes place between Episodes III and IV, while \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" occurs between Episodes III and IV but before Rogue One.\n\n3. Machete Order:\nThis order is designed to maintain the surprise twist in Episode V while incorporating the background from the Prequel Trilogy.\n\n- Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n- Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n- Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n- Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n- Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n- Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\n- Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\n- Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\nIn this order, Episode I is considered optional, and standalone films can be inserted as suggested in the release order.\n\nAs for the second question, Orders 1 through 65 refer to a series of contingency orders issued by the Galactic Republic to the clone troopers. These orders were a set of emergency plans designed to address various potential crises, including treason, assassination, and kidnapping. Order 66, specifically, instructed all clone troopers to execute their Jedi commanders in the event the Jedi were ever deemed a threat to the Republic.\n\nThese questions do not have the same meaning. The first question inquires about the best viewing order for the Star Wars films, while the second question concerns in-universe contingency plans used by the Galactic Republic within the Star Wars universe.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"41\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"t0.237283\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected?  A. Because she thought the other actress did a bad job  B. Because she was treated like a liar  C. not enough information  D.

Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.  - William Walton `` Bill '' Sharman ( May 25 , 1926 -- October 25 , 2013 ) was an American professional basketball player and coach . He is mostly known for his time with the Boston Celtics in the 1950s , partnering with Bob Cousy in what some consider the greatest backcourt duo of all time . As a coach , Sharman won titles in the ABL , ABA , and NBA , and is credited with introducing the morning shootaround . He was a 10 - time NBA Champion ( having won four titles as a player with the Celtics , one as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers , and five as a Lakers executive ) , and a 12 - time World Champion in basketball overall counting his ABL and ABA titles . Sharman is also a two - time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee , having been being inducted in 1976 as a player , and in 2004 as a coach . Only John Wooden , Lenny Wilkens and Tommy Heinsohn share this double honor .  - The TD Garden (previously the Shawmut Center, the FleetCenter, and the TD Banknorth Garden; nicknamed the Boston Garden and The Garden) is a multi-purpose arena in Boston. It is named after its sponsor, TD Bank, a subsidiary of Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank.  - Robert Joseph \"Bob\" Cousy (born August 9, 1928) is an American retired professional basketball player and member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 196970 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All-American for 3 seasons.   - The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division. Founded in 1946 and one of eight NBA teams (out of 23 total teams) to survive the league's first decade, the team is owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC. The Celtics play their home games at the TD Garden, which they share with the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Boston Bruins. The franchise's 17 championships are the most of any NBA franchise, and account for 24.3 percent of all NBA championships since the league's founding in 1946. As a percentage of championships won, the Celtics are the most successful franchise to date in the major four traditional North American professional sports leagues.  - The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. They are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in association football (soccer).  - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and mounted at a height of to backboards at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, who would be the first basketball coach of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful programs in the game's history.

Cutting metal, on the other hand, is a process of separating metal into two or more pieces using various methods, such as sawing, shearing, or plasma cutting.\n4.

This dilation can lead to increased blood flow and a temporary feeling of warmth, which might seem beneficial in a cold situation like a blizzard. \n\nHowever, this effect is counterproductive in such conditions, as the increased blood flow to the skin's surface actually promotes heat loss from the body.

His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of $50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. \n\nBased on the paragraph, does the response \"More jobs, better commute times\" correctly answer the question \"What did the president say would be two significant benefits of spending to rebuild many miles of roads, railways, and runways?\"?\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Yes, the response \"More jobs, better commute times\" correctly answers the question.

Movie title: The Amazing Spider-Man Movie plot: Scientist Richard Parker (Campbell Scott) is playing hide-and-seek with his young son Peter (Max Charles) when he discovers that his study has been broken into. After quickly gathering some hidden documents, Richard and his wife Mary (Embeth Davidtz) leave Peter with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), then mysteriously depart without telling Peter where they are going.Years later, the teenage Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) has become an alienated social outcast. He attends Midtown Science High School, where he pines over his crush Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), while frequently getting bullied by the obnoxious Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka).At home, Peter finds a briefcase containing some of his father's old documents and learns that his father worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans) at a pharmaceutical company named Oscorp. Faking his way into the Oscorp building by pretending to be an intern, Peter sneaks into a laboratory where extremely strong \"biocable\" is being created from genetically-modified spiders. One of the spiders escapes from its container and bites Peter. On the subway ride home, Peter scuffles with a gang of thugs and discovers that he suddenly has increased agility and strength. Upon returning home, he finds the spider hiding in his jacket and stores it away.The next day, Peter goes to Dr. Connors's house and gives him Richard Parker's documents. Dr. Connors explains that he and Richard were researching cross-species genetics in order to find a way to re-grow lost limbs, Dr. Connors being motivated by the loss of his own right arm. Dr. Connors is frustrated because his superior, Dr. Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan), is pressuring him to devise a cure for Oscorp's CEO Norman Osborn, who is terminally ill.Back at school, Peter gets in trouble after accidentally breaking a basketball hoop during a game with Flash.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. “When we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements. Pompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements. The secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program.

This fact is on the surface unrelated to greenhouse gases production. However, if we consider that the spread of diseases among animals could potentially affect agricultural activities (such as livestock farming), which contribute to the production of greenhouse gases, we might find an indirect connection.\n\nFor instance, if more animals become sick and die or need to be culled to prevent the spread of disease, the demand for alternative sources of food might increase. Depending on these alternative sources (e.g., increased land use for crops or an increase in demand for fossil fuels for transportation), the production of greenhouse gases could either increase (more effect) or decrease (less effect) as a consequence of this perturbation.\n\nHowever, without more information on the specific alternative sources of food and their greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to determine the extent of the influence on the second effect mentioned (temperature continues to rise and melts the polar ice caps).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, I would conclude that the supposed perturbation of an animal coming into contact with more sick animals has an uncertain effect on temperature rise and the melting of polar ice caps.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"63\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.450764\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

Sarah has a hard time making friends and feels out of place in her new environment.\n\nStep 2: Establish the setting\nThe story takes place in a small, close-knit town called Mooncrest, surrounded by a dense and mysterious forest, where rumors and myths about supernatural beings lurk in the shadows. The town has a deep-rooted history of witchcraft and occult practices.\n\nStep 3: Introduce the secondary characters\nSarah meets a group of three girls—Luna, Willow, and Aurora—who are seen as outcasts by their peers. The girls are rumored to be witches because of their strange behaviors, mysterious background, and fascination with the town's history.\n\nStep 4: Develop the main character's relationship with the secondary characters\nDespite the rumors, Sarah becomes friendly with Luna, Willow, and Aurora. They take her into their circle of friendship, and Sarah starts to learn about the town's dark past and the girls' complex connection to it. Meanwhile, Sarah begins to feel more confident and at ease with her newfound friends.\n\nStep 5: Introduce a conflict\nThe town experiences a series of strange and inexplicable events, such as mysterious fires and sudden illnesses that affect people who have been hostile to the girls, leading the townsfolk to believe that the girls are the cause. People begin to whisper that the girls are using witchcraft to take revenge on those who wronged them.\n\nStep 6: Present the main character's reaction to the conflict\nAs the town's fear and suspicion grow, Sarah's loyalty to her new friends is tested. She starts to question whether the girls are truly involved in witchcraft or are just innocent victims of the town's paranoia. Sarah becomes determined to find the truth and protect the girls from the mounting hysteria.\n\nStep 7: Build towards the climax\nAs Sarah delves deeper into the mysterious happenings, she discovers that there is indeed supernatural activity in the town - but not from her friends. A secret group, believing they can harness the power of the town's history, are behind the dark occurrences. They plan to use the girls as scapegoats and take control of the town.\n\nStep 8: Climax\nSarah confronts the secret group and exposes their true intentions to the townsfolk, turning public opinion against them. A battle between the forces of good and evil ensues, with Sarah teaming up with the girls to defeat the secret group.\n\nStep 9: Resolution\nAfter the secret group's plan is thwarted, Mooncrest returns to a semblance of normalcy, but the town will never be the same. With their names cleared, Luna, Willow, and Aurora's acceptance grows, and they continue to share their knowledge of the town's real history with others while supporting each other as friends. Sarah is now embraced by her community and becomes a symbol of courage and understanding.\n\nStep 10: Closing scene\nIn the end, we see Sarah and her friends sitting together, laughing and enjoying a beautiful sunset over Mooncrest. They have not only found friendship and acceptance but have also learned that uncovering the truth can be the most powerful magic of all.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"66\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"t0.529100\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

Inhabited on a mysterious island are strange creatures called Boggs who love meat. Unbeknownst to them, it is also inhabited by a shipwrecked boy. He scavenges for some food by distracting the Boggs with animal noises. Far away from the island, Odette and Derek are on their way to help the people by building a bridge leaving Alise in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers, and their animals friends: Speed, Jean-Bob, Puffin and the Scullions. Queen Uberta begins to prepare Alise to learn how to be and act like a princess. But Alise doesn't want to be a princess in this way but to be a modern princess. Lord Rogers says that Alise needs adventure but Queen Uberta disagrees. While fighting once again, Alise uses her chance to swim in the lake with her friends but she was quickly sent back to the palace to learn to be proper. Queen Uberta is very strict with Alise, trying to teach her everything, but instead she falls asleep and sent to bed. That same night, Lord Rogers, Jean-Bob, and Speed sneak Alise out of her room to go on an adventure. The next morning, before Queen Uberta enters Alise's room with yoga lessons, she notices that Alise has gone with Lord Rogers. Queen Uberta chases after the group all the way to the port but they escape on a ship. Queen Uberta is furious but nervous about Alise so she sent Puffin and the Scullions after them. On the ship, Alise changes into a pirate costume, making Lord Rogers realize that Uberta was right; he turned Alise into a pirate just when Alise wanted to have fun.

Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  I am facing a new situation today: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations.

Some of the chemicals can also seep into groundwater and contaminate wells from where people draw drinking water.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on evidence.\nGiven the background knowledge and the specific situation, it is much more probable that Lake Mahoe is exposed to higher levels of chemical contaminants from the nearby farm when compared to Lake Tresco, which doesn't have an identified source of similar contamination close by.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"68\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.399380\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

Disraeli's expansionist foreign policy, which Victoria endorsed, led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. \"If we are to maintain our position as a first-rate Power\", she wrote, \"we must ... be Prepared for attacks and wars, somewhere or other, CONTINUALLY.\" Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign, protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers: \"It is not in our custom to annexe countries\", she said, \"unless we are obliged &amp; forced to do so.\" To Victoria's dismay, Disraeli lost the 1880 general election, and Gladstone returned as prime minister. When Disraeli died the following year, she was blinded by \"fast falling tears\", and erected a memorial tablet \"placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend, Victoria R.I.\"\nWhat position did Victoria take on how to be a successful and top notch power?\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Queen Victoria took a firm stance on the importance of maintaining and expanding the British Empire in order to secure its position as a top-notch, first-rate power during her reign. She believed that this could be achieved through a combination of aggressive foreign policy, military preparedness, and a sense of humanitarian responsibility towards the native populations under British rule.\n\nVictoria had a strong alliance with her Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, who shared her expansionist views. Together, they pushed for British involvement in global conflicts, such as the Russo-Turkish War, the Anglo-Zulu War, and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. It is crucial to note that during the Russo-Turkish War, Queen Victoria pressured Disraeli to act against Russia and even threatened to abdicate five times, showcasing her unwavering determination to assert British interests.\n\nIn her opinion, to maintain Britain's position as a leading power, the country had to be ready for conflicts and wars continually. This militaristic outlook aligned well with the era's prevailing attitude of the \"civilizing mission,\" wherein imperialist nations believed it was their duty to bring progress and enlightenment to the territories they colonized.\n\nFurthermore, Queen Victoria emphasized the protective nature of the British Empire's expansion. She argued that it served as a benign and civilizing force, shielding native populations from aggressive powers or cruel rulers. In this sense, she did not see the annexation of countries as an inherently negative practice but rather as a necessary measure if circumstances demanded it. She claimed that Britain would only annex countries if they were \"obliged and forced to do so.\"\n\nHowever, her close relationship with Disraeli meant she was not always in step with the broader political context. Victoria was deeply dismayed when he lost the 1880 general election to William Gladstone and later died. In memory of their shared vision for imperial Britain, Queen Victoria erected a memorial tablet in Disraeli's honor.\n\nIn summary, Queen Victoria's position for ensuring Britain's success as a top-notch power involved a combination of aggressive and expansionist foreign policy, military preparedness, protection for native populations, and a sense of moral obligation to bring about progress and enlightenment. This approach was firmly tied to the colonial and imperialist attitudes of the 19th century, but it reinforces the importance she placed on asserting Britain's power and influence on the global stage.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"69\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"cot.43857\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.

If more conservation occurs, it means that there will be increased efforts to protect and preserve natural resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity. This can lead to greater awareness and implementation of sustainable practices such as reforestation, limiting deforestation, reducing the use of fossil fuels, and promoting alternative energy sources.\n\nAs a result, the process would be affected in the following ways:\n- Reduced deforestation means more trees to help absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate climate change.\n- Promotion of alternative energy sources can help reduce dependency on fossil fuels, leading to less burning and release of carbon dioxide.\n- Reforestation efforts can help increase the overall number of trees on the planet, which will absorb more carbon dioxide and release oxygen, contributing to a more stabilized atmosphere.\n\nIn conclusion, increased conservation efforts can have an indirect effect on the process by mitigating some of the negative consequences of human activities on the environment, such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. These actions can help contribute to slowing down and potentially reversing climate change and its impact on the earth's short-term weather patterns and long-term climate patterns.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"74\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.867003\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plan ahead, and build your knowledge base about the topics you’re studying for work or school. Additionally, get all of your assignments finished before they’re due. Keep a planner or use the calendar in your phone to help yourself stay on top of things. Maintain good posture by standing up straight and pressing your shoulders back. Smile, keep your arms at your sides, and look at your surroundings. When you talk to people, focus on your talents and achievements, not your flaws. If you want to increase your confidence, do something small every day that makes you feel accomplished. You can also do more things you enjoy and take calculated risks. For example, you might try out for a sports team, enter an art show, or volunteer to take the lead on a project. Punctuality is essential if you want to appear serious and professional. Always be on time or early for things. Set an alarm or calendar entry on your phone to help you remember when you need to be places. Everyone encounters obstacles at one time or another. If you’re going to be late due to an emergency or unforeseen event, call ahead and let people know. Say exactly what you mean, and ask for what you need. Always be kind and respectful when you provide feedback, but don’t be vague because you think it will spare someone’s feelings. Additionally, don’t say more than you need to say.  Don’t expect people to guess what you’re thinking. If it’s important, just tell them. Let's say you're working on a group project and think one person is holding up your progress. You might say, \"Our group project is coming along, but I'm worried you aren't going to be finished with your part on time. Can you get it finished by tomorrow?\" Avoid meaningless chatter, as talking too much can make people see you as unprofessional. Additionally, speaking less often will make your words carry more impact. Keep it professional by only sharing your best thoughts and ideas. For example, don’t add to workplace gossip or chat about topics like TV shows and sports. However, do speak up when you know the answer to a question or when you have a great idea to share. Appearing to be unsure can make you look unprofessional or flaky. At the same time, you’re not going to have all of the answers. To protect your image, respond positively but buy yourself some time to think about what you’ll do or say next. You might say, “That’s a really great point. I’m going to think that over today and get back to you tomorrow with my response,” or “I appreciate your feedback. It’s given me a lot to think about.” Talking about your personal life too often or at the wrong times can make you look less professional. At the same time, talking about your life may help you bond with others. Choose the right times to share personal details about yourself, such as during lunch, breaks, and post-work or after-school events. During work hours or class, stick to topics related to work or school, as well as current events. Similarly, don’t gossip about others’ personal lives. People may perceive you as immature and unprofessional. If your friends or coworkers are gossiping, change the subject. You might say, “All I’m thinking about right now is our project that’s due next week. Have any of you started?” Do what you say you’ll do, when you say you’ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten. If you don’t follow through, people won’t respect you because they’ll perceive you as being immature and unprofessional.\n\nWhat is a summary?\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"A summary of the article entails the importance of appearing professional, maintaining productivity, and building confidence to succeed in work or school environments.

The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides $1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the $25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The Perijá tapaculo is a small bird, 10 to 12 cm (3.9 to 4.7 in) in length with an average mass of 17 to 18 grams (around 0.6 oz). The bill averages 6.8 millimetres (0.27 inches) long, 2.9 mm (0.11 in) wide, and 3.5 mm (0.14 in) high. The legs are about 21 mm (0.83 in) long. The Perijá tapaculo's tarsus averages 21.1 millimetres (0.83 in) long. The wings measure 57.4 mm (2.26 in) on average and the tail is about 40 mm (1.6 in) long with between 8 and 12 rectrices.The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and scapular area are a neutral grey colour. There is a brown spot on the nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and the bottom of their breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.The bird's plumage colouration is most similar to the pale-bellied tapaculo. The S. g. morenoi subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo can be differentiated from the Perijá tapaculo by its entirely brown back and nape, and its different calls. Juveniles of this subspecies have a dull ventral plumage, while the Perijá tapaculo has a more yellow plumage. It also resembles the Caracas tapaculo but has a duller ventral colour.\nA:\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Male specimens of the Perijá tapaculo have brown on the back of their legs and whitish on the front.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"85\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.924160\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

Erin accompanies her boyfriend Crispian Davison to his family reunion at their rural Missouri vacation home, adjacent to the property of the murdered couple. Present are Crispian's parents Aubrey and Paul, his older brother Drake and Drake's wife Kelly, his younger siblings Felix and Aimee, Felix's girlfriend Zee, and Aimee's boyfriend Tariq. During an argument at the dinner table between Drake and Crispian, Tariq and Drake are shot by crossbow bolts from outside the house, Tariq fatally and Drake moderately wounded. With their cell phone signals jammed by the attackers, Aimee runs out the front door to get help, but runs into a garrote wire which slashes her throat. Crispian leaves the house to find help. Aubrey is brought upstairs to her bedroom by Paul; when Paul leaves the room, Fox Mask appears from under the bed and kills Aubrey. The rest of the family rushes upstairs to find Aubrey dead with the words \"You're next\" scrawled on the wall in blood. Erin begins securing the house and texts 911. She encounters Tiger Mask and evades his attack, wounding him in the process. Kelly returns to the bedroom and discovers Fox Mask still hiding under the bed. She panics and runs to the neighboring home. After pounding on the window for help, she gets inside but discovers the murdered couple and is soon killed by a maul-wielding Lamb Mask. Back at the house, Tiger Mask once again fails to murder Erin and is in turn killed by her with a meat tenderizer; it is later revealed that Tiger Mask is actually Lamb Mask's brother. Lamb Mask finds Drake, but Erin stabs him with a screwdriver and he retreats. While exploring the house, Paul finds evidence that the killers had been staying in the house for a while. He tries to tell Zee and Felix, but Fox Mask appears from behind and slashes his throat. It is revealed that Felix and Zee hired the assassins to murder the family and collect their inheritance.

Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel Edouard Brémond was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui . Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, also played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army. The British government in Egypt sent a young officer, Captain T. E. Lawrence, to work with the Hashemite forces in the Hejaz in October 1916. The British historian David Murphy wrote that though Lawrence was just one out of many British and French officers serving in Arabia, historians often write as though it was Lawrence alone who represented the Allied cause in Arabia. David Hogarth credited Gertrude Bell for much of the success of the Arab Revolt. She had travelled extensively in the Middle East since 1888, after graduating from Oxford with a First in Modern History. Bell had met Sheikh Harb of the Howeitat in January 1914 and thus was able to provide a \"mass of information\" which was crucial to the success of Lawrence's occupation of Aqaba covering the \"tribal elements ranging between the Hejaz Railway and the Nefud, particularly about the Howeitat group.\" It was this information, Hogarth emphasized, which \"Lawrence, relying on her reports, made signal use of in the Arab campaigns of 1917 and 1918.\"\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: Which army had more Mulim officer, the English or the French?\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Based on the article, the French army had more Muslim officers than the English army during the Arab Revolt in the Hejaz.

It is not possible to tell.\n\nThe given scenario mentions that two people are wearing a Chinese dragon costume in front of an ornate Chinese gazebo with red pillars, and there are two large red lanterns hanging from the roof. While these elements are commonly associated with Chinese New Year celebrations, we cannot conclusively determine that the people are celebrating Chinese New Year for several reasons:\n\n1. Chinese dragon costumes and red lanterns are symbolic representations used during various cultural and traditional events in China, not just Chinese New Year. For example, they may appear in Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations, weddings, or even business openings.\n\n2. The Chinese dragon costume could be part of a performance or dance that is not explicitly related to Chinese New Year. The dragon dance, for instance, is performed in several other occasions to bring good fortune and chase away evil spirits. Similarly, red lanterns are considered a symbol of happiness and prosperity and can be used as decorations throughout the year.\n\n3. The context of the event or location isn't provided. For example, the scenario could take place at a multicultural festival or a theme park, where costumes and decorations from various cultures are showcased regardless of the time of year.\n\n4. Even if the event seems to include elements that are traditionally associated with Chinese New Year, the people might still be part of a cultural performance or using the decorations for other purposes, such as an art exhibition, photoshoot, or a stage play.\n\nIn summary, while the scenario described provides certain hints towards Chinese New Year celebration, we cannot decisively conclude that the people are celebrating it without additional information or context.

This increase in her workload could lead to stress, both physical and emotional. Let's analyze the options:\n\n1. Asthma: Asthma is generally not caused by stress. It is a chronic lung disease and results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While stress can potentially trigger asthma symptoms in some cases, it is not a direct consequence of the given situation.\n\n2. More: It seems this option is incomplete or unclear. Without any context, we cannot determine what \"more\" may refer to.\n\n3. Boredom: Boredom would be unlikely in this situation, as the wife is dealing with a heavier workload and increased responsibilities. This would leave her with little time to feel bored, as most of her time would be occupied with housework and childcare.\n\n4. Headache: Stress can indeed lead to headaches, which can be caused by tension, muscle strain, or hormonal changes. In the given situation, the wife's increased stress and workload may contribute to the development of headaches.\n\n5. Arguments: The imbalance in shared responsibilities between Randy and his wife could likely lead to arguments and tension in their relationship. The wife may feel overwhelmed and resentful due to the unfair distribution of housework, leading to disagreements and strife in the family.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most plausible outcomes of Randy not doing housework while his wife raises two children are headaches and arguments. These issues could arise from the increased stress, tension, and the unfair division of labor within their household.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"95\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"t0.743414\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

Mrs. Johnson’s class raised $2300, which is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton’s class raised. Mrs. Sutton’s class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin’s class. Miss Rollin’s class raised a third of the total amount raised by the school. How much money did the school raise for the playground if 2% will be deducted for administration fees?.\nMe: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Step 1: Find out how much Mrs. Sutton's class raised. Since Mrs. Johnson's class raised $2300, and that is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton's class raised, we can divide $2300 by 2 to find the amount Mrs. Sutton's class raised:\n2300 ÷ 2 = $1150\n\nStep 2: Find out how much Miss Rollin's class raised. Since Mrs. Sutton's class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin's class, we can multiply the amount Mrs. Sutton's class raised by 8 to find the amount Miss Rollin's class raised:\n1150 × 8 = $9200\n\nStep 3: Find the total amount raised by the school before deducting the administration fees. Since Miss Rollin's class raised a third of the total amount, we can multiply the amount Miss Rollin's class raised by 3 to find the total amount raised by the school before deducting the fees:\n9200 × 3 = $27,600\n\nStep 4: Calculate the amount of administration fees that need to be deducted. Since 2% of the total amount raised will be deducted for administration fees, we multiply the total amount by 0.02 (2% as a decimal):\n27,600 × 0.02 = $552\n\nStep 5: Subtract the administration fees from the total amount raised to find the final amount raised for the playground:\n27,600 - 552 = $27,048\n\nSo, Tree Elementary School raised a total of $27,048 for the new playground after deducting the 2% administration fees.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"98\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.1551633\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

You have this beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through you? Can you feel the majesty of the Lord's kingdom and how you're a part of it? Take a moment to kneel and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith and how you feel currently. Think about how you've been responding to God's call and how you've been living in the light of his love. When the priest is ready for you, of course. You'll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it's totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous. He won't treat you any differently either way. Make the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It has been (blank) since my last confession.\" This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that's fine, too. The priest knows what he's doing. The Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you. Once you sit down and you've made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest's lead. He'll ask you how long it's been since your last confession (if you don't voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. It's just a casual conversation! Do not fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you're more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession! This part is intimidating, but think about it this way: the priest you're talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, \"I did so and so,\" will suffice. Your priest is going to be very understanding. If you don't remember the exact timeframe, that's fine. If you don't remember your motivation, that's fine. All your priest cares about is that you're being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place. He'll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, sin and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He's there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this:  My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,I have sinned against You whom I should loveabove all things. I firmly intend, with your help,to do penance, to sin no more, andto avoid whatever leads me to sin.Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.In his name, my God, have mercy  (If you are a Roman Catholic, your act of contrition will go like this: Oh my God, I am very sorry for having offended thee. I detest all of my sins because of thy just punishment. But most of all, because they offend you, my God, who is all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace, to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen. Don't worry! It won't be anything huge. You may even walk away just having to say a few meaningful prayers. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, clean slate to work with. It'll feel so uplifting! Just to clarify, \"absolution\" means your sins are washed away. \"Penance\" is your expression of regret and repentance, showing God that you're truly sorry for what you've done and that you wish for nothing more than to be forgiven.\n\nSummary:\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\"

This makes the writing more personal and engaging.\\n- Write notes: Writing notes can help improve writing skills to some extent, but might not allow for the kind of continuous practice that John needs.\\n- Write poems: This is another creative option to practice writing, but it might not be the best choice if John struggles with the basics of writing and is not yet comfortable with more advanced forms such as poetry.\\n\\nStep 3: Choose the most suitable option based on the analysis:\\nGiven the options, writing letters seems to be the best advice for John to follow when considering people he knows.

You must generate a detailed and long answer.\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?\\nOne of the first complaints presented to doctors by many people later diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face. You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses.  There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling\\&quot; movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor. Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous.  These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \\&quot;festinating gait,\\&quot; and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down.  Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD.\\n\\nSummary:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Involuntary tremors, slowed movements, and posture and balance issues are common early symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, often accompanied by disturbances in voluntary movements, speech, mood, and gastrointestinal issues as the disease progresses.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:9,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.1317837\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

The village is home to the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, which covers 6.58 square miles (17.0 km2) of land and most of the village of Briarcliff Manor and an unincorporated portion of the town of Mount Pleasant. Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District. The district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day &amp; Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978. Since then, The Clear View School has run a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21 there.

Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\&quot;a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\&quot; with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\&quot;Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\&quot; While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.\\nThe answer is:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Kennedy\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:20,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.791495\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long did it take the driver to get to his workplace?

Our expectations for Amy's upcoming album of \\&quot;jukebox stuff\\&quot; have been raised. ||||| When it was announced that the first bit of music the world would hear from Amy Winehouse after all that tabloid trouble would be a cover of Lesley Gore's \\&quot;It's My Party” for a Quincy Jones tribute album, Vulture found it just a touch uninspiring. But now the cover is actually here, and it's tough not to get carried away. Winehouse lets it fly on the Mark Ronson–produced do-over — turning in a dialed-in, muscular vocal performance that moves effortlessly from louche to anguished — and sounds not even a tiny bit horribly addicted to drugs while doing so. No word on an official Back to Black follow-up or anything, of course, but there is one other potentially positive sign: Winehouse has gone from tweeting stuff like “ronson you're dead to me; one album i write an you take half the credit — make a career out of it? don't think so BRUV” to things like “can't find me bleedin notebooks — theyve done a runsies xxxxxxxx LOVE YOU RONSON XXXXXXxxxxxxxxx.” ||||| Image Credit: Samir Hussein/Getty ImagesIf there’s something we know our beloved little wayward beehive enjoys, it’s a good party.

Authorities arrested Greek fashion publicist Phivos Lampros Istavrioglou, 29, in the case; he has pleaded not guilty, the Wall Street Journal reports. The back story: At the gallery, Istavrioglou realized the $150,000 drawing was unprotected and removed it, taking it with him back to Athens, prosecutors say. Once he arrived, prosecutors say he had second thoughts. \\&quot;When he realized the hunt was on, the defendant blinked\\&quot; and sent it back, rolling it up \\&quot;in a manner befitting a college dorm-room poster.\\&quot; Among the evidence detectives are said to have uncovered in the case: Istavriglou's fingerprint on the mailing tube, relevant Web searches made from his Google account before the story broke, and a photo of the drawing in the gallery that he posted to his Facebook page. Istavrioglou was caught after an undercover cop posed as a New York art gallery manager and offered him a job, returning him to the Big Apple. He's due back in court today, the New York Times notes.\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Title: An Unlikely Heist: The Tale of Salvador Dali Art Theft and its Intriguing Resolution\\n\\nAfter a thief casually strolled into a New York gallery, walked out with a Salvador Dali drawing, and then promptly returned the stolen art via mail, numerous observers were left puzzled. However, an explanation has emerged through the justice system. Authorities recently arrested Greek fashion publicist Phivos Lampros Istavrioglou, 29, in connection with the theft. Istavrioglou pleaded not guilty.\\n\\nThe backstory of this unusual crime starts at the New York gallery, where Istavrioglou noticed that a $150,000 Salvador Dali drawing was not properly protected. He seized the opportunity and took the drawing. He transported the artwork from New York City, to Athens, Greece, where he resides. However, upon arriving in Athens, Istavrioglou experienced a change of heart. In fear of being caught, prosecutors say Istavrioglou decided to return the precious art piece.\\n\\n\\&quot;When he realized the hunt was on, the defendant blinked,\\&quot; the prosecutor stated. In a hasty move to avoid any ramifications, Istavrioglou rolled up the Salvador Dali drawing and sent it back to the gallery. His method of rolling can be best described as \\&quot;a manner befitting a college dorm-room poster,\\&quot; reflecting a naive approach rather than a heist expert's precision.\\n\\nDetectives have managed to uncover several pieces of evidence that point to Istavrioglou's involvement in the peculiar crime. Among these pieces of evidence is his fingerprint found on the mailing tube used to return the drawing. Additional information implicating Istavrioglou includes relevant web searches made on his Google account in the period leading up to the story breaking. Furthermore, a picture of the drawing, as it hung in the gallery, was featured on Istavrioglou's Facebook profile.\\n\\nThe Greek fashion publicist was apprehended in New York City, following communication with an undercover cop who posed as an art gallery manager. The undercover officer lured Istavrioglou back to the Big Apple by offering him a lucrative job opportunity. Once in New York, officers closed in and arrested him without incident. Istavrioglou appeared in court soon after and pleaded not guilty.\\n\\nNow that the Salvador Dali drawing has been safely returned, the consequences faced by Istavrioglou remain uncertain. As a high-profile suspect in an art theft turned intriguing global case, the enigmatic nature of the criminal act and its intriguing resolution will leave many captivated and puzzled in the world of art galleries and beyond. This unusual case serves as a testament to the unpredictability of human nature, coupled with the ability for even the unlikeliest of individuals to become involved in an art heist.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:31,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.2161311\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The next day, December 26, 1991, the Council of Republics, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, issued a formal Declaration recognizing that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a state and subject of international law, and voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence (the other chamber of the Supreme Soviet, the Council of the Union, had been unable to work since December 12, 1991, when the recall of the Russian deputies left it without a quorum). The following day Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's former office, though the Russian authorities had taken over the suite two days earlier.

On the night of December 25, Mikhail Gorbachev left the Kremlin, and the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time at 7:32 p.m. Moscow time, with the Russian tricolor raised in its place. This symbolically marked the end of the Soviet Union. The following day, December 26, the Council of Republics, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, issued a Declaration recognizing that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a state and subject of international law. This vote effectively disbanded both itself and the Soviet Union. The Council of the Union, another chamber of the Supreme Soviet, had already been unable to work since December 12, due to the recall of the Russian deputies, which left it without a quorum. On December 27, Boris Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's former office, although the Russian authorities had taken control of the suite two days prior. By December 31, the remaining Soviet institutions that had not been absorbed by Russia ceased operations, and the individual republics assumed the roles of the previous central government.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:33,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.1069722\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

In the second quarter, Buffalo took the lead as kicker Rian Lindell made a 21-yard field goal.  Kansas City answered with Thigpen completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez.  Buffalo regained the lead as Lindell got a 39-yard field goal, while rookie CB Leodis McKelvin returned an interception 64 yards for a touchdown.  The Chiefs struck back with kicker Connor Barth getting a 45-yard field goal, yet the Bills continued their offensive explosion as Lindell got a 34-yard field goal, along with QB Trent Edwards getting a 15-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Buffalo continued its poundings with Edwards getting a 5-yard TD run, while Lindell got himself a 38-yard field goal.  Kansas City tried to rally as Thigpen completed a 45-yard TD pass to WR Mark Bradley, yet the Bills replied with Edwards completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Josh Reed.  In the fourth quarter, Buffalo pulled away as Edwards completed a 17-yard TD pass to TE Derek Schouman.  The Chiefs tried to come back as QB Quinn Gray completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe, yet the Bills' lead was too much for Kansas City to overcome.

I will list three of them below:\\n\\n1. Release Order:\\nThis is the order in which the films were released in theaters, starting with the Original Trilogy followed by the Prequel Trilogy and then the Sequel Trilogy. This order captures the experience of watching the films as they were introduced to the world.\\n\\n- Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)\\n- Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\\n- Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\\n- Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\\n- Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\\n- Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\\n- Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\\n- Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\\n- Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\\n\\nAdditionally, you may insert the standalone movies \\&quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\\&quot; (2016) after Episode III and \\&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story\\&quot; (2018) after Episode VIII.\\n\\n2. Chronological Order:\\nAlthough not the order in which the films were released, this option follows the timeline of the Star Wars universe.\\n\\n- Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\\n- Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\\n- Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\\n- Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)\\n- Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\\n- Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\\n- Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\\n- Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\\n- Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\\n\\n\\&quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\\&quot; takes place between Episodes III and IV, while \\&quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story\\&quot; occurs between Episodes III and IV but before Rogue One.\\n\\n3.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected?  A. Because she thought the other actress did a bad job  B. Because she was treated like a liar  C. not enough information  D.

Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.  - William Walton `` Bill '' Sharman ( May 25 , 1926 -- October 25 , 2013 ) was an American professional basketball player and coach . He is mostly known for his time with the Boston Celtics in the 1950s , partnering with Bob Cousy in what some consider the greatest backcourt duo of all time . As a coach , Sharman won titles in the ABL , ABA , and NBA , and is credited with introducing the morning shootaround . He was a 10 - time NBA Champion ( having won four titles as a player with the Celtics , one as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers , and five as a Lakers executive ) , and a 12 - time World Champion in basketball overall counting his ABL and ABA titles . Sharman is also a two - time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee , having been being inducted in 1976 as a player , and in 2004 as a coach . Only John Wooden , Lenny Wilkens and Tommy Heinsohn share this double honor .  - The TD Garden (previously the Shawmut Center, the FleetCenter, and the TD Banknorth Garden; nicknamed the Boston Garden and The Garden) is a multi-purpose arena in Boston. It is named after its sponsor, TD Bank, a subsidiary of Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank.  - Robert Joseph \\&quot;Bob\\&quot; Cousy (born August 9, 1928) is an American retired professional basketball player and member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 196970 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All-American for 3 seasons.   - The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division.

The Celtics play their home games at the TD Garden, which they share with the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Boston Bruins. The franchise's 17 championships are the most of any NBA franchise, and account for 24.3 percent of all NBA championships since the league's founding in 1946. As a percentage of championships won, the Celtics are the most successful franchise to date in the major four traditional North American professional sports leagues.  - The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. They are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in association football (soccer).  - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and mounted at a height of to backboards at each end of the court.

The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true.

Remember, the premise is always true.\\n\\nIn this case, the premise is, \\&quot;A woman in white with her arms folded smiling as a man is laughing holding cotton candy.\\&quot;\\n\\n2. Understand the hypothesis: Read the provided hypothesis sentence that describes an assumption or inference about the situation based on the premise.\\n\\nIn this case, the hypothesis is, \\&quot;A woman watches her husband buying cotton candy at a carnival.\\&quot;\\n\\n3. Analyze the update: Read the update sentence that provides additional information about the situation. This update can either weaken or strengthen the hypothesis.\\n\\nIn this case, the update is, \\&quot;The woman does not know the man.\\&quot;\\n\\n4. Determine if the update is a strengthener or weakener: Assess if the update makes the hypothesis more likely to be true (strengthener) or less likely to be true (weakener) based on the relationship between the premise, hypothesis, and update.\\n\\nIn this case, the update weakens the hypothesis because the woman does not know the man, making it less likely that the man is her husband.\\n\\n5. Provide the answer: Based on your analysis, answer whether the update is a strengthener or weakener for the hypothesis. In this case, the answer is 'weakener.'\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:47,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;niv.432975\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\&quot;Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\&quot; said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\&quot;We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\&quot; he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\&quot;This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\&quot; said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of $50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. \\n\\nBased on the paragraph, does the response \\&quot;More jobs, better commute times\\&quot; correctly answer the question \\&quot;What did the president say would be two significant benefits of spending to rebuild many miles of roads, railways, and runways?\\&quot;?\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Yes, the response \\&quot;More jobs, better commute times\\&quot; correctly answers the question.

He attends Midtown Science High School, where he pines over his crush Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), while frequently getting bullied by the obnoxious Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka).At home, Peter finds a briefcase containing some of his father's old documents and learns that his father worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans) at a pharmaceutical company named Oscorp. Faking his way into the Oscorp building by pretending to be an intern, Peter sneaks into a laboratory where extremely strong \\&quot;biocable\\&quot; is being created from genetically-modified spiders. One of the spiders escapes from its container and bites Peter. On the subway ride home, Peter scuffles with a gang of thugs and discovers that he suddenly has increased agility and strength. Upon returning home, he finds the spider hiding in his jacket and stores it away.The next day, Peter goes to Dr. Connors's house and gives him Richard Parker's documents. Dr. Connors explains that he and Richard were researching cross-species genetics in order to find a way to re-grow lost limbs, Dr. Connors being motivated by the loss of his own right arm. Dr. Connors is frustrated because his superior, Dr. Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan), is pressuring him to devise a cure for Oscorp's CEO Norman Osborn, who is terminally ill.Back at school, Peter gets in trouble after accidentally breaking a basketball hoop during a game with Flash.

The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity. On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and  Bin Laden. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA. When the former  Bin Laden unit chief found out about Clarke's call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance. Imagery confirmed that less than a week after Clarke's phone call the camp was hurriedly dismantled, and the site was deserted. CIA officers, including Deputy Director for Operations Pavitt, were irate.\\&quot; Mike\\&quot; thought the dismantling of the camp erased a possible site for targeting  Bin Laden. The United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem. From 1999 through early 2001, the United States, and President Clinton personally, pressed the UAE, one of the Taliban's only travel and financial outlets to the outside world, to break off its ties and enforce sanctions, especially those relating to flights to and from Afghanistan. These efforts achieved little before 9/11. In July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over  Bin Laden. The Taliban did not take him seriously, however. Bin Zayid later told an American diplomat that the UAE valued its relations with the Taliban because the Afghan radicals offered a counterbalance to \\&quot;Iranian dangers\\&quot; in the region, but he also noted that the UAE did not want to upset the United States. \\n\\nQuestion: \\&quot;Why did Hamdan bin Zayid's threat to break relations with the Taliban achieve little results before 9/11?\\&quot;\\n\\nResponse: \\&quot;UAE\\&quot;\\nAvailable choices:\\n(a). no\\n(b). yes\\nDoes the response correctly answer the question?\\n\\n\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;The provided response \\&quot;UAE\\&quot; does not correctly answer the question.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. “When we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements. Pompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements. The secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program.

This fact is on the surface unrelated to greenhouse gases production. However, if we consider that the spread of diseases among animals could potentially affect agricultural activities (such as livestock farming), which contribute to the production of greenhouse gases, we might find an indirect connection.\\n\\nFor instance, if more animals become sick and die or need to be culled to prevent the spread of disease, the demand for alternative sources of food might increase. Depending on these alternative sources (e.g., increased land use for crops or an increase in demand for fossil fuels for transportation), the production of greenhouse gases could either increase (more effect) or decrease (less effect) as a consequence of this perturbation.\\n\\nHowever, without more information on the specific alternative sources of food and their greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to determine the extent of the influence on the second effect mentioned (temperature continues to rise and melts the polar ice caps).\\n\\nTherefore, based on the given information, I would conclude that the supposed perturbation of an animal coming into contact with more sick animals has an uncertain effect on temperature rise and the melting of polar ice caps.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:63,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.450764\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

The victims are often women and their children and they frequently have few resources with which to pursue their legal rights,\\&quot; Trout said Tuesday. \\&quot;This campaign helps fill that gap in legal services for women who need the help at a time when they are in crisis.\\&quot; The Idaho Partners for Justice Project has already secured pledges of more than $35,000 from law firms, attorneys, corporations and individuals. The goal is $100,000. The drive to pay for free legal services will continue for the next two months. The money goes to Idaho Legal Aid Services and the Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program. Last year, more than 5,000 petitions were filed in Idaho for protection orders in domestic violence cases. More than 12,000 victims contacted shelters or crisis hotlines. Joining Trout in the announcement was Idaho Bar Association President Fred Hoopes of Idaho Falls and Ida-West Energy Co. Chief Executive Officer Randy Hill, members of the project's executive committee. Also on hand were some women who were victims of such violence, but benefited from free legal services.

Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  I am facing a new situation today: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations.

No information is provided about potential sources of contamination near Lake Tresco.\\n\\nStep 2: Locate the sources near the lakes.\\nLake Mahoe is situated right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops. This implies that fertilizers and pesticides are likely applied.\\n\\nStep 3: Consider chemical runoff.\\nRainwater can pick up chemicals from the farm fields and carry them into the lake, causing contamination. There is no mention of any similar process occurring near Lake Tresco.\\n\\nStep 4: Consider the effects of these chemicals.\\nThe absorbed fertilizer can enhance the growth of water plants and algae, sometimes to detrimental levels, leading to dead zones where nothing can live. Some of the chemicals can also seep into groundwater and contaminate wells from where people draw drinking water.\\n\\nStep 5: Conclude based on evidence.\\nGiven the background knowledge and the specific situation, it is much more probable that Lake Mahoe is exposed to higher levels of chemical contaminants from the nearby farm when compared to Lake Tresco, which doesn't have an identified source of similar contamination close by.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:68,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.399380\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

Disraeli's expansionist foreign policy, which Victoria endorsed, led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. \\&quot;If we are to maintain our position as a first-rate Power\\&quot;, she wrote, \\&quot;we must ... be Prepared for attacks and wars, somewhere or other, CONTINUALLY.\\&quot; Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign, protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers: \\&quot;It is not in our custom to annexe countries\\&quot;, she said, \\&quot;unless we are obliged &amp; forced to do so.\\&quot; To Victoria's dismay, Disraeli lost the 1880 general election, and Gladstone returned as prime minister. When Disraeli died the following year, she was blinded by \\&quot;fast falling tears\\&quot;, and erected a memorial tablet \\&quot;placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend, Victoria R.I.\\&quot;\\nWhat position did Victoria take on how to be a successful and top notch power?\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Queen Victoria took a firm stance on the importance of maintaining and expanding the British Empire in order to secure its position as a top-notch, first-rate power during her reign. She believed that this could be achieved through a combination of aggressive foreign policy, military preparedness, and a sense of humanitarian responsibility towards the native populations under British rule.\\n\\nVictoria had a strong alliance with her Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, who shared her expansionist views. Together, they pushed for British involvement in global conflicts, such as the Russo-Turkish War, the Anglo-Zulu War, and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. It is crucial to note that during the Russo-Turkish War, Queen Victoria pressured Disraeli to act against Russia and even threatened to abdicate five times, showcasing her unwavering determination to assert British interests.\\n\\nIn her opinion, to maintain Britain's position as a leading power, the country had to be ready for conflicts and wars continually. This militaristic outlook aligned well with the era's prevailing attitude of the \\&quot;civilizing mission,\\&quot; wherein imperialist nations believed it was their duty to bring progress and enlightenment to the territories they colonized.\\n\\nFurthermore, Queen Victoria emphasized the protective nature of the British Empire's expansion. She argued that it served as a benign and civilizing force, shielding native populations from aggressive powers or cruel rulers. In this sense, she did not see the annexation of countries as an inherently negative practice but rather as a necessary measure if circumstances demanded it. She claimed that Britain would only annex countries if they were \\&quot;obliged and forced to do so.\\&quot;\\n\\nHowever, her close relationship with Disraeli meant she was not always in step with the broader political context. Victoria was deeply dismayed when he lost the 1880 general election to William Gladstone and later died. In memory of their shared vision for imperial Britain, Queen Victoria erected a memorial tablet in Disraeli's honor.\\n\\nIn summary, Queen Victoria's position for ensuring Britain's success as a top-notch power involved a combination of aggressive and expansionist foreign policy, military preparedness, protection for native populations, and a sense of moral obligation to bring about progress and enlightenment. This approach was firmly tied to the colonial and imperialist attitudes of the 19th century, but it reinforces the importance she placed on asserting Britain's power and influence on the global stage.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:69,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;cot.43857\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.

An insulted Gloria, whose dress is torn, takes Liggett's wife Emily's (Dina Merrill) mink coat to cover herself and scrawls \\&quot;No Sale\\&quot; in lipstick on the mirror, but she orders her telephone answering service, BUtterfield 8, to put Liggett through if he calls. Gloria visits a childhood friend, pianist Steve Carpenter, who chastises her for wasting her life on one-night stands but agrees to ask his girlfriend Norma to lend her a dress. Gloria leaves, and Norma tells Steve to choose between her and Gloria. Liggett takes a train to the countryside where his wife Emily is caring for her mother. A friend, Bingham Smith, advises him to end his adulterous relationships and return to Bing's law firm instead of working for the chemical business of Emily's father. Meanwhile, Gloria lies to her mother Annie, claiming to have spent the night at Norma's. Liggett returns home. Finding the lipstick and money, he phones Gloria to explain the money was meant for her to buy a new dress, to replace the one that he had torn. While drinking later that night, Liggett advises her to ask a high price for her lovemaking talents. She insists she does not take payment from her dates and claims she has been hired as a model to advertise the dress she is wearing at three bistros that night. Liggett follows Gloria, watching her flirt with dozens of men at several clubs. He then drives her to a run-down motel. After sleeping together, Liggett and Gloria decide to explore their relationship further. Together for five days, they grow closer, falling genuinely in love with one another and parting only upon the return of Liggett's wife., can you guess it ?\\nAnswer:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;The full name of the man who works for a chemical business in the provided article is Weston Liggett.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:71,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.796480\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

Some examples of objects that may work are a small book, an eraser, or a small, flat object with some heft.\\n\\nStep 3: Clean the object\\nBefore placing the object on the keyboard, clean it so it doesn't leave any dirt or debris on the keys.\\n\\nStep 4: Position the object carefully\\nCarefully place the object exactly over the key that needs to be held down. Make sure that it only presses the desired key and doesn't accidentally press any of the adjacent keys.\\n\\nStep 5: Test the result\\nOnce the object is placed correctly over the key, check to see if the key is being held down successfully. If it's not pressed down enough or it's pressing other keys, reposition the object accordingly.\\n\\nStep 6: Monitoring the situation\\nPeriodically check on the setup to ensure the keyboard is functioning correctly and that the object hasn't moved or fallen off.\\n\\nIn these steps, I have successfully managed to hold down a keyboard note without using my hands by utilizing a suitable object as a substitute to apply weight on the key.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:72,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.1848382\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?\\nA:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Yes, the perturbation hypothesis does have an indirect effect on the process. If more conservation occurs, it means that there will be increased efforts to protect and preserve natural resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity. This can lead to greater awareness and implementation of sustainable practices such as reforestation, limiting deforestation, reducing the use of fossil fuels, and promoting alternative energy sources.\\n\\nAs a result, the process would be affected in the following ways:\\n- Reduced deforestation means more trees to help absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate climate change.\\n- Promotion of alternative energy sources can help reduce dependency on fossil fuels, leading to less burning and release of carbon dioxide.\\n- Reforestation efforts can help increase the overall number of trees on the planet, which will absorb more carbon dioxide and release oxygen, contributing to a more stabilized atmosphere.\\n\\nIn conclusion, increased conservation efforts can have an indirect effect on the process by mitigating some of the negative consequences of human activities on the environment, such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. These actions can help contribute to slowing down and potentially reversing climate change and its impact on the earth's short-term weather patterns and long-term climate patterns.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:74,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.867003\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plan ahead, and build your knowledge base about the topics you’re studying for work or school. Additionally, get all of your assignments finished before they’re due. Keep a planner or use the calendar in your phone to help yourself stay on top of things. Maintain good posture by standing up straight and pressing your shoulders back. Smile, keep your arms at your sides, and look at your surroundings. When you talk to people, focus on your talents and achievements, not your flaws. If you want to increase your confidence, do something small every day that makes you feel accomplished. You can also do more things you enjoy and take calculated risks. For example, you might try out for a sports team, enter an art show, or volunteer to take the lead on a project. Punctuality is essential if you want to appear serious and professional. Always be on time or early for things. Set an alarm or calendar entry on your phone to help you remember when you need to be places. Everyone encounters obstacles at one time or another. If you’re going to be late due to an emergency or unforeseen event, call ahead and let people know. Say exactly what you mean, and ask for what you need. Always be kind and respectful when you provide feedback, but don’t be vague because you think it will spare someone’s feelings. Additionally, don’t say more than you need to say.  Don’t expect people to guess what you’re thinking. If it’s important, just tell them. Let's say you're working on a group project and think one person is holding up your progress. You might say, \\&quot;Our group project is coming along, but I'm worried you aren't going to be finished with your part on time. Can you get it finished by tomorrow?\\&quot; Avoid meaningless chatter, as talking too much can make people see you as unprofessional. Additionally, speaking less often will make your words carry more impact. Keep it professional by only sharing your best thoughts and ideas. For example, don’t add to workplace gossip or chat about topics like TV shows and sports. However, do speak up when you know the answer to a question or when you have a great idea to share. Appearing to be unsure can make you look unprofessional or flaky. At the same time, you’re not going to have all of the answers. To protect your image, respond positively but buy yourself some time to think about what you’ll do or say next. You might say, “That’s a really great point. I’m going to think that over today and get back to you tomorrow with my response,” or “I appreciate your feedback. It’s given me a lot to think about.” Talking about your personal life too often or at the wrong times can make you look less professional. At the same time, talking about your life may help you bond with others. Choose the right times to share personal details about yourself, such as during lunch, breaks, and post-work or after-school events. During work hours or class, stick to topics related to work or school, as well as current events. Similarly, don’t gossip about others’ personal lives. People may perceive you as immature and unprofessional. If your friends or coworkers are gossiping, change the subject. You might say, “All I’m thinking about right now is our project that’s due next week. Have any of you started?” Do what you say you’ll do, when you say you’ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten. If you don’t follow through, people won’t respect you because they’ll perceive you as being immature and unprofessional.\\n\\nWhat is a summary?\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;A summary of the article entails the importance of appearing professional, maintaining productivity, and building confidence to succeed in work or school environments.

The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides $1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the $25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The Perijá tapaculo is a small bird, 10 to 12 cm (3.9 to 4.7 in) in length with an average mass of 17 to 18 grams (around 0.6 oz). The bill averages 6.8 millimetres (0.27 inches) long, 2.9 mm (0.11 in) wide, and 3.5 mm (0.14 in) high. The legs are about 21 mm (0.83 in) long. The Perijá tapaculo's tarsus averages 21.1 millimetres (0.83 in) long. The wings measure 57.4 mm (2.26 in) on average and the tail is about 40 mm (1.6 in) long with between 8 and 12 rectrices.The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and scapular area are a neutral grey colour. There is a brown spot on the nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and the bottom of their breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.The bird's plumage colouration is most similar to the pale-bellied tapaculo. The S. g. morenoi subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo can be differentiated from the Perijá tapaculo by its entirely brown back and nape, and its different calls. Juveniles of this subspecies have a dull ventral plumage, while the Perijá tapaculo has a more yellow plumage. It also resembles the Caracas tapaculo but has a duller ventral colour.\\nA:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Male specimens of the Perijá tapaculo have brown on the back of their legs and whitish on the front.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:85,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.924160\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: You're Next Movie plot: The film opens with a couple being murdered in their house by assailants wearing various animal masks. Erin accompanies her boyfriend Crispian Davison to his family reunion at their rural Missouri vacation home, adjacent to the property of the murdered couple. Present are Crispian's parents Aubrey and Paul, his older brother Drake and Drake's wife Kelly, his younger siblings Felix and Aimee, Felix's girlfriend Zee, and Aimee's boyfriend Tariq. During an argument at the dinner table between Drake and Crispian, Tariq and Drake are shot by crossbow bolts from outside the house, Tariq fatally and Drake moderately wounded. With their cell phone signals jammed by the attackers, Aimee runs out the front door to get help, but runs into a garrote wire which slashes her throat. Crispian leaves the house to find help. Aubrey is brought upstairs to her bedroom by Paul; when Paul leaves the room, Fox Mask appears from under the bed and kills Aubrey. The rest of the family rushes upstairs to find Aubrey dead with the words \\&quot;You're next\\&quot; scrawled on the wall in blood. Erin begins securing the house and texts 911. She encounters Tiger Mask and evades his attack, wounding him in the process. Kelly returns to the bedroom and discovers Fox Mask still hiding under the bed. She panics and runs to the neighboring home. After pounding on the window for help, she gets inside but discovers the murdered couple and is soon killed by a maul-wielding Lamb Mask. Back at the house, Tiger Mask once again fails to murder Erin and is in turn killed by her with a meat tenderizer; it is later revealed that Tiger Mask is actually Lamb Mask's brother. Lamb Mask finds Drake, but Erin stabs him with a screwdriver and he retreats. While exploring the house, Paul finds evidence that the killers had been staying in the house for a while. He tries to tell Zee and Felix, but Fox Mask appears from behind and slashes his throat. It is revealed that Felix and Zee hired the assassins to murder the family and collect their inheritance.

Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel Edouard Brémond was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui . Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, also played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army. The British government in Egypt sent a young officer, Captain T. E. Lawrence, to work with the Hashemite forces in the Hejaz in October 1916. The British historian David Murphy wrote that though Lawrence was just one out of many British and French officers serving in Arabia, historians often write as though it was Lawrence alone who represented the Allied cause in Arabia. David Hogarth credited Gertrude Bell for much of the success of the Arab Revolt. She had travelled extensively in the Middle East since 1888, after graduating from Oxford with a First in Modern History. Bell had met Sheikh Harb of the Howeitat in January 1914 and thus was able to provide a \\&quot;mass of information\\&quot; which was crucial to the success of Lawrence's occupation of Aqaba covering the \\&quot;tribal elements ranging between the Hejaz Railway and the Nefud, particularly about the Howeitat group.\\&quot; It was this information, Hogarth emphasized, which \\&quot;Lawrence, relying on her reports, made signal use of in the Arab campaigns of 1917 and 1918.\\&quot;\\n\\nAnswer this question based on the article: Which army had more Mulim officer, the English or the French?\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Based on the article, the French army had more Muslim officers than the English army during the Arab Revolt in the Hejaz.

While these elements are commonly associated with Chinese New Year celebrations, we cannot conclusively determine that the people are celebrating Chinese New Year for several reasons:\\n\\n1. Chinese dragon costumes and red lanterns are symbolic representations used during various cultural and traditional events in China, not just Chinese New Year. For example, they may appear in Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations, weddings, or even business openings.\\n\\n2. The Chinese dragon costume could be part of a performance or dance that is not explicitly related to Chinese New Year. The dragon dance, for instance, is performed in several other occasions to bring good fortune and chase away evil spirits. Similarly, red lanterns are considered a symbol of happiness and prosperity and can be used as decorations throughout the year.\\n\\n3. The context of the event or location isn't provided. For example, the scenario could take place at a multicultural festival or a theme park, where costumes and decorations from various cultures are showcased regardless of the time of year.\\n\\n4. Even if the event seems to include elements that are traditionally associated with Chinese New Year, the people might still be part of a cultural performance or using the decorations for other purposes, such as an art exhibition, photoshoot, or a stage play.\\n\\nIn summary, while the scenario described provides certain hints towards Chinese New Year celebration, we cannot decisively conclude that the people are celebrating it without additional information or context.

This increase in her workload could lead to stress, both physical and emotional. Let's analyze the options:\\n\\n1. Asthma: Asthma is generally not caused by stress. It is a chronic lung disease and results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While stress can potentially trigger asthma symptoms in some cases, it is not a direct consequence of the given situation.\\n\\n2. More: It seems this option is incomplete or unclear. Without any context, we cannot determine what \\&quot;more\\&quot; may refer to.\\n\\n3. Boredom: Boredom would be unlikely in this situation, as the wife is dealing with a heavier workload and increased responsibilities. This would leave her with little time to feel bored, as most of her time would be occupied with housework and childcare.\\n\\n4. Headache: Stress can indeed lead to headaches, which can be caused by tension, muscle strain, or hormonal changes. In the given situation, the wife's increased stress and workload may contribute to the development of headaches.\\n\\n5. Arguments: The imbalance in shared responsibilities between Randy and his wife could likely lead to arguments and tension in their relationship. The wife may feel overwhelmed and resentful due to the unfair distribution of housework, leading to disagreements and strife in the family.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the most plausible outcomes of Randy not doing housework while his wife raises two children are headaches and arguments. These issues could arise from the increased stress, tension, and the unfair division of labor within their household.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:95,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;t0.743414\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

Mrs. Johnson’s class raised $2300, which is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton’s class raised. Mrs. Sutton’s class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin’s class. Miss Rollin’s class raised a third of the total amount raised by the school. How much money did the school raise for the playground if 2% will be deducted for administration fees?.\\nMe: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Step 1: Find out how much Mrs. Sutton's class raised. Since Mrs. Johnson's class raised $2300, and that is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton's class raised, we can divide $2300 by 2 to find the amount Mrs. Sutton's class raised:\\n2300 ÷ 2 = $1150\\n\\nStep 2: Find out how much Miss Rollin's class raised. Since Mrs. Sutton's class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin's class, we can multiply the amount Mrs. Sutton's class raised by 8 to find the amount Miss Rollin's class raised:\\n1150 × 8 = $9200\\n\\nStep 3: Find the total amount raised by the school before deducting the administration fees. Since Miss Rollin's class raised a third of the total amount, we can multiply the amount Miss Rollin's class raised by 3 to find the total amount raised by the school before deducting the fees:\\n9200 × 3 = $27,600\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate the amount of administration fees that need to be deducted. Since 2% of the total amount raised will be deducted for administration fees, we multiply the total amount by 0.02 (2% as a decimal):\\n27,600 × 0.02 = $552\\n\\nStep 5: Subtract the administration fees from the total amount raised to find the final amount raised for the playground:\\n27,600 - 552 = $27,048\\n\\nSo, Tree Elementary School raised a total of $27,048 for the new playground after deducting the 2% administration fees.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:98,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.1551633\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant.

They're funnier and better than every other movie combined. They might as well have stopped making movies after \\&quot;Cannonball Run 2\\&quot;, but I guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones? Man this movie's good. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the luxuriant Loni Anderson is on hand, looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure loved that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I laughed so hard I almost passed away into the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then never watch another movie again, because I tell you right now: there's no point.\\n\\nDid this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?\\npick from the following. +negative. +positive....I think the answer is\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;+positive.\\&quot;&quot;}}},{&quot;rowIdx&quot;:99,&quot;cells&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;flan.2108115\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;system_prompt&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;question&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?\\nYou could go directly into the confessional (provided there's no one else in there or waiting outside), but sometimes it's nice to take a minute in the pew by yourself beforehand. You have this beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through you? Can you feel the majesty of the Lord's kingdom and how you're a part of it? Take a moment to kneel and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith and how you feel currently. Think about how you've been responding to God's call and how you've been living in the light of his love. When the priest is ready for you, of course. You'll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it's totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous. He won't treat you any differently either way. Make the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, \\&quot;Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It has been (blank) since my last confession.\\&quot; This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that's fine, too. The priest knows what he's doing. The Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you. Once you sit down and you've made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest's lead. He'll ask you how long it's been since your last confession (if you don't voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. It's just a casual conversation! Do not fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you're more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession! This part is intimidating, but think about it this way: the priest you're talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, \\&quot;I did so and so,\\&quot; will suffice. Your priest is going to be very understanding. If you don't remember the exact timeframe, that's fine. If you don't remember your motivation, that's fine. All your priest cares about is that you're being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place. He'll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, sin and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He's there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this:  My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,I have sinned against You whom I should loveabove all things. I firmly intend, with your help,to do penance, to sin no more, andto avoid whatever leads me to sin.Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.In his name, my God, have mercy  (If you are a Roman Catholic, your act of contrition will go like this: Oh my God, I am very sorry for having offended thee. I detest all of my sins because of thy just punishment. But most of all, because they offend you, my God, who is all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace, to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen. Don't worry! It won't be anything huge. You may even walk away just having to say a few meaningful prayers. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, clean slate to work with. It'll feel so uplifting! Just to clarify, \\&quot;absolution\\&quot; means your sins are washed away. \\&quot;Penance\\&quot; is your expression of regret and repentance, showing God that you're truly sorry for what you've done and that you wish for nothing more than to be forgiven.\\n\\nSummary:\\&quot;&quot;},&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;The article provides guidance on the process of confession in a church, emphasizing the importance of reflection, honest conversation with the priest, and the act of contrition for a meaningful and pressure-free experience, ultimately leading to absolution and spiritual growth.\\&quot;&quot;}}}],&quot;columns&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;id&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;depends on text direction&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;id (string)&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;system_prompt&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;depends on text direction&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;system_prompt (string)&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;question&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;depends on text direction&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;question (string)&quot;},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;response&quot;,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;depends on text direction&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;response (string)&quot;}],&quot;truncated&quot;:false,&quot;basePath&quot;:&quot;/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca/viewer/default/train&quot;}\" data-target=\"DatasetViewerTable\"><div class=\" relative overflow-auto border-t\"><table class=\"w-full table-auto rounded-lg font-mono text-xs text-gray-900\"><thead class=\"sticky top-0 left-0 right-0 z-10 bg-white shadow-sm\"><tr class=\"space-y-54 divide-x border-b text-left\"><th class=\"max-w-sm p-2 text-left\">id (string)</th><th class=\"max-w-sm p-2 text-left\">system_prompt (string)</th><th class=\"max-w-sm p-2 text-left\">question (string)</th><th class=\"max-w-sm p-2 text-left\">response (string)</th></tr></thead> <tbody class=\"h-16 overflow-scroll\"><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"0\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"niv.242684\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.\nThis task is about using the specified sentence and converting the sentence to Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplets of the form (subject, predicate object).

You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses.  There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling\" movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor. Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous.  These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \"festinating gait,\" and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down.  Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD.\n\nSummary:\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Involuntary tremors, slowed movements, and posture and balance issues are common early symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, often accompanied by disturbances in voluntary movements, speech, mood, and gastrointestinal issues as the disease progresses.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"9\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.1317837\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

The only downside mentioned by the reviewer is the unavailability of the movie on DVD, but this does not detract from their overall positive experience.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"17\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"cot.57163\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.

Context: Heliocentrism is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System. Historically, Heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BCE by Aristarchus of Samos, but at least in the medieval world, Aristarchus's Heliocentrism attracted little attention -- possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era.\n\nQuestion: who said sun is the center of the solar system?\nAnswer.

This historical context is important to understand the significance of heliocentrism and the person who proposed it.\n\nStep 3: Identify key figures related to the heliocentric model.\nThe question asks for the individual who initially proposed the Sun as the center of the solar system. Aristarchus of Samos is mentioned as the person who proposed this model as early as the 3rd century BCE.\n\nStep 4: Verify the credibility of the claim.\nThe text mentions that Aristarchus's heliocentrism attracted little attention at the time possibly due to the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era, implying that his proposal was indeed an early instance of heliocentrism.\n\nStep 5: Combine the findings to form the answer.\nBased on the historical context, the opposing views, and the identification of Aristarchus of Samos as the individual who proposed the Sun as the center of the solar system, the answer to the question \"who said the Sun is the center of the solar system?\" is Aristarchus of Samos.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"18\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"t0.1164694\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The village is home to the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, which covers 6.58 square miles (17.0 km2) of land and most of the village of Briarcliff Manor and an unincorporated portion of the town of Mount Pleasant. Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District. The district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day &amp; Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978. Since then, The Clear View School has run a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21 there. The Macfadden School ran from 1939 to 1950 at the William Kingsland mansion in the village.\nAnswer:\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Briarcliff High School is part of the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"19\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"t0.4801\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose biography was Michael Kennedy?  Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.\nThe answer is:\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Kennedy\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"20\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.791495\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Our expectations for Amy's upcoming album of \"jukebox stuff\" have been raised. ||||| When it was announced that the first bit of music the world would hear from Amy Winehouse after all that tabloid trouble would be a cover of Lesley Gore's \"It's My Party” for a Quincy Jones tribute album, Vulture found it just a touch uninspiring. But now the cover is actually here, and it's tough not to get carried away. Winehouse lets it fly on the Mark Ronson–produced do-over — turning in a dialed-in, muscular vocal performance that moves effortlessly from louche to anguished — and sounds not even a tiny bit horribly addicted to drugs while doing so. No word on an official Back to Black follow-up or anything, of course, but there is one other potentially positive sign: Winehouse has gone from tweeting stuff like “ronson you're dead to me; one album i write an you take half the credit — make a career out of it? don't think so BRUV” to things like “can't find me bleedin notebooks — theyve done a runsies xxxxxxxx LOVE YOU RONSON XXXXXXxxxxxxxxx.” ||||| Image Credit: Samir Hussein/Getty ImagesIf there’s something we know our beloved little wayward beehive enjoys, it’s a good party. And apparently, this one ends in tears. \n  \n The 27-year-old Grammy winner returned to the studio recently for the star-strewn Quincy Jones release Q: Soul Bossa Nostra, due November 9, with her Back to Black producer (and recent subject of a Wino tweet-spanking) Mark Ronson. \n  \n You can hear their recording of Lesley Gore’s 1963 teenage cri de coeur “It’s My Party” \n  \n over at NYmag.com (via Soundcloud). The RonHouse pairing proves as Spector-esquely fruitful as ever—though frankly, whether the reasons are stylistic or substance-related, Amy’s penchant for slurring her vocals yields something closer to “Ish My Parrry.” \n  \n What do you think?

However, an explanation has emerged through the justice system. Authorities recently arrested Greek fashion publicist Phivos Lampros Istavrioglou, 29, in connection with the theft. Istavrioglou pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe backstory of this unusual crime starts at the New York gallery, where Istavrioglou noticed that a $150,000 Salvador Dali drawing was not properly protected. He seized the opportunity and took the drawing. He transported the artwork from New York City, to Athens, Greece, where he resides. However, upon arriving in Athens, Istavrioglou experienced a change of heart. In fear of being caught, prosecutors say Istavrioglou decided to return the precious art piece.\n\n\"When he realized the hunt was on, the defendant blinked,\" the prosecutor stated. In a hasty move to avoid any ramifications, Istavrioglou rolled up the Salvador Dali drawing and sent it back to the gallery. His method of rolling can be best described as \"a manner befitting a college dorm-room poster,\" reflecting a naive approach rather than a heist expert's precision.\n\nDetectives have managed to uncover several pieces of evidence that point to Istavrioglou's involvement in the peculiar crime. Among these pieces of evidence is his fingerprint found on the mailing tube used to return the drawing. Additional information implicating Istavrioglou includes relevant web searches made on his Google account in the period leading up to the story breaking. Furthermore, a picture of the drawing, as it hung in the gallery, was featured on Istavrioglou's Facebook profile.\n\nThe Greek fashion publicist was apprehended in New York City, following communication with an undercover cop who posed as an art gallery manager. The undercover officer lured Istavrioglou back to the Big Apple by offering him a lucrative job opportunity. Once in New York, officers closed in and arrested him without incident. Istavrioglou appeared in court soon after and pleaded not guilty.\n\nNow that the Salvador Dali drawing has been safely returned, the consequences faced by Istavrioglou remain uncertain. As a high-profile suspect in an art theft turned intriguing global case, the enigmatic nature of the criminal act and its intriguing resolution will leave many captivated and puzzled in the world of art galleries and beyond. This unusual case serves as a testament to the unpredictability of human nature, coupled with the ability for even the unlikeliest of individuals to become involved in an art heist.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"31\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.2161311\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the night of December 25, Mikhail Gorbachev left the Kremlin, and the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time at 7:32 p.m. Moscow time, with the Russian tricolor raised in its place. This symbolically marked the end of the Soviet Union. The following day, December 26, the Council of Republics, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, issued a Declaration recognizing that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a state and subject of international law.

In the first quarter, Buffalo trailed early as Chiefs QB Tyler Thigpen completed a 36-yard TD pass to RB Jamaal Charles.  The Bills responded with RB Marshawn Lynch getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Buffalo took the lead as kicker Rian Lindell made a 21-yard field goal.  Kansas City answered with Thigpen completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez.  Buffalo regained the lead as Lindell got a 39-yard field goal, while rookie CB Leodis McKelvin returned an interception 64 yards for a touchdown.  The Chiefs struck back with kicker Connor Barth getting a 45-yard field goal, yet the Bills continued their offensive explosion as Lindell got a 34-yard field goal, along with QB Trent Edwards getting a 15-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Buffalo continued its poundings with Edwards getting a 5-yard TD run, while Lindell got himself a 38-yard field goal.  Kansas City tried to rally as Thigpen completed a 45-yard TD pass to WR Mark Bradley, yet the Bills replied with Edwards completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Josh Reed.  In the fourth quarter, Buffalo pulled away as Edwards completed a 17-yard TD pass to TE Derek Schouman.  The Chiefs tried to come back as QB Quinn Gray completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe, yet the Bills' lead was too much for Kansas City to overcome.

I will list three of them below:\n\n1. Release Order:\nThis is the order in which the films were released in theaters, starting with the Original Trilogy followed by the Prequel Trilogy and then the Sequel Trilogy. This order captures the experience of watching the films as they were introduced to the world.\n\n- Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n- Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n- Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n- Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n- Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n- Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n- Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\n- Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\n- Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\nAdditionally, you may insert the standalone movies \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" (2016) after Episode III and \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" (2018) after Episode VIII.\n\n2. Chronological Order:\nAlthough not the order in which the films were released, this option follows the timeline of the Star Wars universe.\n\n- Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n- Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n- Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n- Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n- Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n- Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n- Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\n- Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\n- Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\n\"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" takes place between Episodes III and IV, while \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" occurs between Episodes III and IV but before Rogue One.\n\n3. Machete Order:\nThis order is designed to maintain the surprise twist in Episode V while incorporating the background from the Prequel Trilogy.\n\n- Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n- Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n- Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n- Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n- Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n- Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\n- Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\n- Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\nIn this order, Episode I is considered optional, and standalone films can be inserted as suggested in the release order.\n\nAs for the second question, Orders 1 through 65 refer to a series of contingency orders issued by the Galactic Republic to the clone troopers. These orders were a set of emergency plans designed to address various potential crises, including treason, assassination, and kidnapping. Order 66, specifically, instructed all clone troopers to execute their Jedi commanders in the event the Jedi were ever deemed a threat to the Republic.\n\nThese questions do not have the same meaning. The first question inquires about the best viewing order for the Star Wars films, while the second question concerns in-universe contingency plans used by the Galactic Republic within the Star Wars universe.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"41\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"t0.237283\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected?  A. Because she thought the other actress did a bad job  B. Because she was treated like a liar  C. not enough information  D.

Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.  - William Walton `` Bill '' Sharman ( May 25 , 1926 -- October 25 , 2013 ) was an American professional basketball player and coach . He is mostly known for his time with the Boston Celtics in the 1950s , partnering with Bob Cousy in what some consider the greatest backcourt duo of all time . As a coach , Sharman won titles in the ABL , ABA , and NBA , and is credited with introducing the morning shootaround . He was a 10 - time NBA Champion ( having won four titles as a player with the Celtics , one as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers , and five as a Lakers executive ) , and a 12 - time World Champion in basketball overall counting his ABL and ABA titles . Sharman is also a two - time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee , having been being inducted in 1976 as a player , and in 2004 as a coach . Only John Wooden , Lenny Wilkens and Tommy Heinsohn share this double honor .  - The TD Garden (previously the Shawmut Center, the FleetCenter, and the TD Banknorth Garden; nicknamed the Boston Garden and The Garden) is a multi-purpose arena in Boston. It is named after its sponsor, TD Bank, a subsidiary of Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank.  - Robert Joseph \"Bob\" Cousy (born August 9, 1928) is an American retired professional basketball player and member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 196970 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All-American for 3 seasons.   - The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division. Founded in 1946 and one of eight NBA teams (out of 23 total teams) to survive the league's first decade, the team is owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC. The Celtics play their home games at the TD Garden, which they share with the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Boston Bruins. The franchise's 17 championships are the most of any NBA franchise, and account for 24.3 percent of all NBA championships since the league's founding in 1946. As a percentage of championships won, the Celtics are the most successful franchise to date in the major four traditional North American professional sports leagues.  - The point guard (PG), also called the one or point, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A point guard has perhaps the most specialized role of any position. They are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right players at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in association football (soccer).  - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and mounted at a height of to backboards at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, who would be the first basketball coach of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful programs in the game's history.

Cutting metal, on the other hand, is a process of separating metal into two or more pieces using various methods, such as sawing, shearing, or plasma cutting.\n4.

This dilation can lead to increased blood flow and a temporary feeling of warmth, which might seem beneficial in a cold situation like a blizzard. \n\nHowever, this effect is counterproductive in such conditions, as the increased blood flow to the skin's surface actually promotes heat loss from the body.

His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of $50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. \n\nBased on the paragraph, does the response \"More jobs, better commute times\" correctly answer the question \"What did the president say would be two significant benefits of spending to rebuild many miles of roads, railways, and runways?\"?\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Yes, the response \"More jobs, better commute times\" correctly answers the question.

Movie title: The Amazing Spider-Man Movie plot: Scientist Richard Parker (Campbell Scott) is playing hide-and-seek with his young son Peter (Max Charles) when he discovers that his study has been broken into. After quickly gathering some hidden documents, Richard and his wife Mary (Embeth Davidtz) leave Peter with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), then mysteriously depart without telling Peter where they are going.Years later, the teenage Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) has become an alienated social outcast. He attends Midtown Science High School, where he pines over his crush Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), while frequently getting bullied by the obnoxious Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka).At home, Peter finds a briefcase containing some of his father's old documents and learns that his father worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans) at a pharmaceutical company named Oscorp. Faking his way into the Oscorp building by pretending to be an intern, Peter sneaks into a laboratory where extremely strong \"biocable\" is being created from genetically-modified spiders. One of the spiders escapes from its container and bites Peter. On the subway ride home, Peter scuffles with a gang of thugs and discovers that he suddenly has increased agility and strength. Upon returning home, he finds the spider hiding in his jacket and stores it away.The next day, Peter goes to Dr. Connors's house and gives him Richard Parker's documents. Dr. Connors explains that he and Richard were researching cross-species genetics in order to find a way to re-grow lost limbs, Dr. Connors being motivated by the loss of his own right arm. Dr. Connors is frustrated because his superior, Dr. Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan), is pressuring him to devise a cure for Oscorp's CEO Norman Osborn, who is terminally ill.Back at school, Peter gets in trouble after accidentally breaking a basketball hoop during a game with Flash.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. “When we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements. Pompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements. The secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program.

This fact is on the surface unrelated to greenhouse gases production. However, if we consider that the spread of diseases among animals could potentially affect agricultural activities (such as livestock farming), which contribute to the production of greenhouse gases, we might find an indirect connection.\n\nFor instance, if more animals become sick and die or need to be culled to prevent the spread of disease, the demand for alternative sources of food might increase. Depending on these alternative sources (e.g., increased land use for crops or an increase in demand for fossil fuels for transportation), the production of greenhouse gases could either increase (more effect) or decrease (less effect) as a consequence of this perturbation.\n\nHowever, without more information on the specific alternative sources of food and their greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to determine the extent of the influence on the second effect mentioned (temperature continues to rise and melts the polar ice caps).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, I would conclude that the supposed perturbation of an animal coming into contact with more sick animals has an uncertain effect on temperature rise and the melting of polar ice caps.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"63\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.450764\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

Sarah has a hard time making friends and feels out of place in her new environment.\n\nStep 2: Establish the setting\nThe story takes place in a small, close-knit town called Mooncrest, surrounded by a dense and mysterious forest, where rumors and myths about supernatural beings lurk in the shadows. The town has a deep-rooted history of witchcraft and occult practices.\n\nStep 3: Introduce the secondary characters\nSarah meets a group of three girls—Luna, Willow, and Aurora—who are seen as outcasts by their peers. The girls are rumored to be witches because of their strange behaviors, mysterious background, and fascination with the town's history.\n\nStep 4: Develop the main character's relationship with the secondary characters\nDespite the rumors, Sarah becomes friendly with Luna, Willow, and Aurora. They take her into their circle of friendship, and Sarah starts to learn about the town's dark past and the girls' complex connection to it. Meanwhile, Sarah begins to feel more confident and at ease with her newfound friends.\n\nStep 5: Introduce a conflict\nThe town experiences a series of strange and inexplicable events, such as mysterious fires and sudden illnesses that affect people who have been hostile to the girls, leading the townsfolk to believe that the girls are the cause. People begin to whisper that the girls are using witchcraft to take revenge on those who wronged them.\n\nStep 6: Present the main character's reaction to the conflict\nAs the town's fear and suspicion grow, Sarah's loyalty to her new friends is tested. She starts to question whether the girls are truly involved in witchcraft or are just innocent victims of the town's paranoia. Sarah becomes determined to find the truth and protect the girls from the mounting hysteria.\n\nStep 7: Build towards the climax\nAs Sarah delves deeper into the mysterious happenings, she discovers that there is indeed supernatural activity in the town - but not from her friends. A secret group, believing they can harness the power of the town's history, are behind the dark occurrences. They plan to use the girls as scapegoats and take control of the town.\n\nStep 8: Climax\nSarah confronts the secret group and exposes their true intentions to the townsfolk, turning public opinion against them. A battle between the forces of good and evil ensues, with Sarah teaming up with the girls to defeat the secret group.\n\nStep 9: Resolution\nAfter the secret group's plan is thwarted, Mooncrest returns to a semblance of normalcy, but the town will never be the same. With their names cleared, Luna, Willow, and Aurora's acceptance grows, and they continue to share their knowledge of the town's real history with others while supporting each other as friends. Sarah is now embraced by her community and becomes a symbol of courage and understanding.\n\nStep 10: Closing scene\nIn the end, we see Sarah and her friends sitting together, laughing and enjoying a beautiful sunset over Mooncrest. They have not only found friendship and acceptance but have also learned that uncovering the truth can be the most powerful magic of all.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"66\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"t0.529100\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

Inhabited on a mysterious island are strange creatures called Boggs who love meat. Unbeknownst to them, it is also inhabited by a shipwrecked boy. He scavenges for some food by distracting the Boggs with animal noises. Far away from the island, Odette and Derek are on their way to help the people by building a bridge leaving Alise in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers, and their animals friends: Speed, Jean-Bob, Puffin and the Scullions. Queen Uberta begins to prepare Alise to learn how to be and act like a princess. But Alise doesn't want to be a princess in this way but to be a modern princess. Lord Rogers says that Alise needs adventure but Queen Uberta disagrees. While fighting once again, Alise uses her chance to swim in the lake with her friends but she was quickly sent back to the palace to learn to be proper. Queen Uberta is very strict with Alise, trying to teach her everything, but instead she falls asleep and sent to bed. That same night, Lord Rogers, Jean-Bob, and Speed sneak Alise out of her room to go on an adventure. The next morning, before Queen Uberta enters Alise's room with yoga lessons, she notices that Alise has gone with Lord Rogers. Queen Uberta chases after the group all the way to the port but they escape on a ship. Queen Uberta is furious but nervous about Alise so she sent Puffin and the Scullions after them. On the ship, Alise changes into a pirate costume, making Lord Rogers realize that Uberta was right; he turned Alise into a pirate just when Alise wanted to have fun.

Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  I am facing a new situation today: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations.

Some of the chemicals can also seep into groundwater and contaminate wells from where people draw drinking water.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on evidence.\nGiven the background knowledge and the specific situation, it is much more probable that Lake Mahoe is exposed to higher levels of chemical contaminants from the nearby farm when compared to Lake Tresco, which doesn't have an identified source of similar contamination close by.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"68\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.399380\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

Disraeli's expansionist foreign policy, which Victoria endorsed, led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. \"If we are to maintain our position as a first-rate Power\", she wrote, \"we must ... be Prepared for attacks and wars, somewhere or other, CONTINUALLY.\" Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign, protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers: \"It is not in our custom to annexe countries\", she said, \"unless we are obliged &amp; forced to do so.\" To Victoria's dismay, Disraeli lost the 1880 general election, and Gladstone returned as prime minister. When Disraeli died the following year, she was blinded by \"fast falling tears\", and erected a memorial tablet \"placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend, Victoria R.I.\"\nWhat position did Victoria take on how to be a successful and top notch power?\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Queen Victoria took a firm stance on the importance of maintaining and expanding the British Empire in order to secure its position as a top-notch, first-rate power during her reign. She believed that this could be achieved through a combination of aggressive foreign policy, military preparedness, and a sense of humanitarian responsibility towards the native populations under British rule.\n\nVictoria had a strong alliance with her Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, who shared her expansionist views. Together, they pushed for British involvement in global conflicts, such as the Russo-Turkish War, the Anglo-Zulu War, and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. It is crucial to note that during the Russo-Turkish War, Queen Victoria pressured Disraeli to act against Russia and even threatened to abdicate five times, showcasing her unwavering determination to assert British interests.\n\nIn her opinion, to maintain Britain's position as a leading power, the country had to be ready for conflicts and wars continually. This militaristic outlook aligned well with the era's prevailing attitude of the \"civilizing mission,\" wherein imperialist nations believed it was their duty to bring progress and enlightenment to the territories they colonized.\n\nFurthermore, Queen Victoria emphasized the protective nature of the British Empire's expansion. She argued that it served as a benign and civilizing force, shielding native populations from aggressive powers or cruel rulers. In this sense, she did not see the annexation of countries as an inherently negative practice but rather as a necessary measure if circumstances demanded it. She claimed that Britain would only annex countries if they were \"obliged and forced to do so.\"\n\nHowever, her close relationship with Disraeli meant she was not always in step with the broader political context. Victoria was deeply dismayed when he lost the 1880 general election to William Gladstone and later died. In memory of their shared vision for imperial Britain, Queen Victoria erected a memorial tablet in Disraeli's honor.\n\nIn summary, Queen Victoria's position for ensuring Britain's success as a top-notch power involved a combination of aggressive and expansionist foreign policy, military preparedness, protection for native populations, and a sense of moral obligation to bring about progress and enlightenment. This approach was firmly tied to the colonial and imperialist attitudes of the 19th century, but it reinforces the importance she placed on asserting Britain's power and influence on the global stage.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"69\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"cot.43857\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.

If more conservation occurs, it means that there will be increased efforts to protect and preserve natural resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity. This can lead to greater awareness and implementation of sustainable practices such as reforestation, limiting deforestation, reducing the use of fossil fuels, and promoting alternative energy sources.\n\nAs a result, the process would be affected in the following ways:\n- Reduced deforestation means more trees to help absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate climate change.\n- Promotion of alternative energy sources can help reduce dependency on fossil fuels, leading to less burning and release of carbon dioxide.\n- Reforestation efforts can help increase the overall number of trees on the planet, which will absorb more carbon dioxide and release oxygen, contributing to a more stabilized atmosphere.\n\nIn conclusion, increased conservation efforts can have an indirect effect on the process by mitigating some of the negative consequences of human activities on the environment, such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. These actions can help contribute to slowing down and potentially reversing climate change and its impact on the earth's short-term weather patterns and long-term climate patterns.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"74\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.867003\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plan ahead, and build your knowledge base about the topics you’re studying for work or school. Additionally, get all of your assignments finished before they’re due. Keep a planner or use the calendar in your phone to help yourself stay on top of things. Maintain good posture by standing up straight and pressing your shoulders back. Smile, keep your arms at your sides, and look at your surroundings. When you talk to people, focus on your talents and achievements, not your flaws. If you want to increase your confidence, do something small every day that makes you feel accomplished. You can also do more things you enjoy and take calculated risks. For example, you might try out for a sports team, enter an art show, or volunteer to take the lead on a project. Punctuality is essential if you want to appear serious and professional. Always be on time or early for things. Set an alarm or calendar entry on your phone to help you remember when you need to be places. Everyone encounters obstacles at one time or another. If you’re going to be late due to an emergency or unforeseen event, call ahead and let people know. Say exactly what you mean, and ask for what you need. Always be kind and respectful when you provide feedback, but don’t be vague because you think it will spare someone’s feelings. Additionally, don’t say more than you need to say.  Don’t expect people to guess what you’re thinking. If it’s important, just tell them. Let's say you're working on a group project and think one person is holding up your progress. You might say, \"Our group project is coming along, but I'm worried you aren't going to be finished with your part on time. Can you get it finished by tomorrow?\" Avoid meaningless chatter, as talking too much can make people see you as unprofessional. Additionally, speaking less often will make your words carry more impact. Keep it professional by only sharing your best thoughts and ideas. For example, don’t add to workplace gossip or chat about topics like TV shows and sports. However, do speak up when you know the answer to a question or when you have a great idea to share. Appearing to be unsure can make you look unprofessional or flaky. At the same time, you’re not going to have all of the answers. To protect your image, respond positively but buy yourself some time to think about what you’ll do or say next. You might say, “That’s a really great point. I’m going to think that over today and get back to you tomorrow with my response,” or “I appreciate your feedback. It’s given me a lot to think about.” Talking about your personal life too often or at the wrong times can make you look less professional. At the same time, talking about your life may help you bond with others. Choose the right times to share personal details about yourself, such as during lunch, breaks, and post-work or after-school events. During work hours or class, stick to topics related to work or school, as well as current events. Similarly, don’t gossip about others’ personal lives. People may perceive you as immature and unprofessional. If your friends or coworkers are gossiping, change the subject. You might say, “All I’m thinking about right now is our project that’s due next week. Have any of you started?” Do what you say you’ll do, when you say you’ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten. If you don’t follow through, people won’t respect you because they’ll perceive you as being immature and unprofessional.\n\nWhat is a summary?\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"A summary of the article entails the importance of appearing professional, maintaining productivity, and building confidence to succeed in work or school environments.

The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides $1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the $25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The Perijá tapaculo is a small bird, 10 to 12 cm (3.9 to 4.7 in) in length with an average mass of 17 to 18 grams (around 0.6 oz). The bill averages 6.8 millimetres (0.27 inches) long, 2.9 mm (0.11 in) wide, and 3.5 mm (0.14 in) high. The legs are about 21 mm (0.83 in) long. The Perijá tapaculo's tarsus averages 21.1 millimetres (0.83 in) long. The wings measure 57.4 mm (2.26 in) on average and the tail is about 40 mm (1.6 in) long with between 8 and 12 rectrices.The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and scapular area are a neutral grey colour. There is a brown spot on the nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and the bottom of their breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.The bird's plumage colouration is most similar to the pale-bellied tapaculo. The S. g. morenoi subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo can be differentiated from the Perijá tapaculo by its entirely brown back and nape, and its different calls. Juveniles of this subspecies have a dull ventral plumage, while the Perijá tapaculo has a more yellow plumage. It also resembles the Caracas tapaculo but has a duller ventral colour.\nA:\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Male specimens of the Perijá tapaculo have brown on the back of their legs and whitish on the front.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"85\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.924160\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

Erin accompanies her boyfriend Crispian Davison to his family reunion at their rural Missouri vacation home, adjacent to the property of the murdered couple. Present are Crispian's parents Aubrey and Paul, his older brother Drake and Drake's wife Kelly, his younger siblings Felix and Aimee, Felix's girlfriend Zee, and Aimee's boyfriend Tariq. During an argument at the dinner table between Drake and Crispian, Tariq and Drake are shot by crossbow bolts from outside the house, Tariq fatally and Drake moderately wounded. With their cell phone signals jammed by the attackers, Aimee runs out the front door to get help, but runs into a garrote wire which slashes her throat. Crispian leaves the house to find help. Aubrey is brought upstairs to her bedroom by Paul; when Paul leaves the room, Fox Mask appears from under the bed and kills Aubrey. The rest of the family rushes upstairs to find Aubrey dead with the words \"You're next\" scrawled on the wall in blood. Erin begins securing the house and texts 911. She encounters Tiger Mask and evades his attack, wounding him in the process. Kelly returns to the bedroom and discovers Fox Mask still hiding under the bed. She panics and runs to the neighboring home. After pounding on the window for help, she gets inside but discovers the murdered couple and is soon killed by a maul-wielding Lamb Mask. Back at the house, Tiger Mask once again fails to murder Erin and is in turn killed by her with a meat tenderizer; it is later revealed that Tiger Mask is actually Lamb Mask's brother. Lamb Mask finds Drake, but Erin stabs him with a screwdriver and he retreats. While exploring the house, Paul finds evidence that the killers had been staying in the house for a while. He tries to tell Zee and Felix, but Fox Mask appears from behind and slashes his throat. It is revealed that Felix and Zee hired the assassins to murder the family and collect their inheritance.

Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel Edouard Brémond was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui . Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, also played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army. The British government in Egypt sent a young officer, Captain T. E. Lawrence, to work with the Hashemite forces in the Hejaz in October 1916. The British historian David Murphy wrote that though Lawrence was just one out of many British and French officers serving in Arabia, historians often write as though it was Lawrence alone who represented the Allied cause in Arabia. David Hogarth credited Gertrude Bell for much of the success of the Arab Revolt. She had travelled extensively in the Middle East since 1888, after graduating from Oxford with a First in Modern History. Bell had met Sheikh Harb of the Howeitat in January 1914 and thus was able to provide a \"mass of information\" which was crucial to the success of Lawrence's occupation of Aqaba covering the \"tribal elements ranging between the Hejaz Railway and the Nefud, particularly about the Howeitat group.\" It was this information, Hogarth emphasized, which \"Lawrence, relying on her reports, made signal use of in the Arab campaigns of 1917 and 1918.\"\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: Which army had more Mulim officer, the English or the French?\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Based on the article, the French army had more Muslim officers than the English army during the Arab Revolt in the Hejaz.

It is not possible to tell.\n\nThe given scenario mentions that two people are wearing a Chinese dragon costume in front of an ornate Chinese gazebo with red pillars, and there are two large red lanterns hanging from the roof. While these elements are commonly associated with Chinese New Year celebrations, we cannot conclusively determine that the people are celebrating Chinese New Year for several reasons:\n\n1. Chinese dragon costumes and red lanterns are symbolic representations used during various cultural and traditional events in China, not just Chinese New Year. For example, they may appear in Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations, weddings, or even business openings.\n\n2. The Chinese dragon costume could be part of a performance or dance that is not explicitly related to Chinese New Year. The dragon dance, for instance, is performed in several other occasions to bring good fortune and chase away evil spirits. Similarly, red lanterns are considered a symbol of happiness and prosperity and can be used as decorations throughout the year.\n\n3. The context of the event or location isn't provided. For example, the scenario could take place at a multicultural festival or a theme park, where costumes and decorations from various cultures are showcased regardless of the time of year.\n\n4. Even if the event seems to include elements that are traditionally associated with Chinese New Year, the people might still be part of a cultural performance or using the decorations for other purposes, such as an art exhibition, photoshoot, or a stage play.\n\nIn summary, while the scenario described provides certain hints towards Chinese New Year celebration, we cannot decisively conclude that the people are celebrating it without additional information or context.

This increase in her workload could lead to stress, both physical and emotional. Let's analyze the options:\n\n1. Asthma: Asthma is generally not caused by stress. It is a chronic lung disease and results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While stress can potentially trigger asthma symptoms in some cases, it is not a direct consequence of the given situation.\n\n2. More: It seems this option is incomplete or unclear. Without any context, we cannot determine what \"more\" may refer to.\n\n3. Boredom: Boredom would be unlikely in this situation, as the wife is dealing with a heavier workload and increased responsibilities. This would leave her with little time to feel bored, as most of her time would be occupied with housework and childcare.\n\n4. Headache: Stress can indeed lead to headaches, which can be caused by tension, muscle strain, or hormonal changes. In the given situation, the wife's increased stress and workload may contribute to the development of headaches.\n\n5. Arguments: The imbalance in shared responsibilities between Randy and his wife could likely lead to arguments and tension in their relationship. The wife may feel overwhelmed and resentful due to the unfair distribution of housework, leading to disagreements and strife in the family.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most plausible outcomes of Randy not doing housework while his wife raises two children are headaches and arguments. These issues could arise from the increased stress, tension, and the unfair division of labor within their household.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"95\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"t0.743414\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

Mrs. Johnson’s class raised $2300, which is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton’s class raised. Mrs. Sutton’s class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin’s class. Miss Rollin’s class raised a third of the total amount raised by the school. How much money did the school raise for the playground if 2% will be deducted for administration fees?.\nMe: Hmmm, let me think. I think this is the detailed solution:\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"Step 1: Find out how much Mrs. Sutton's class raised. Since Mrs. Johnson's class raised $2300, and that is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton's class raised, we can divide $2300 by 2 to find the amount Mrs. Sutton's class raised:\n2300 ÷ 2 = $1150\n\nStep 2: Find out how much Miss Rollin's class raised. Since Mrs. Sutton's class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin's class, we can multiply the amount Mrs. Sutton's class raised by 8 to find the amount Miss Rollin's class raised:\n1150 × 8 = $9200\n\nStep 3: Find the total amount raised by the school before deducting the administration fees. Since Miss Rollin's class raised a third of the total amount, we can multiply the amount Miss Rollin's class raised by 3 to find the total amount raised by the school before deducting the fees:\n9200 × 3 = $27,600\n\nStep 4: Calculate the amount of administration fees that need to be deducted. Since 2% of the total amount raised will be deducted for administration fees, we multiply the total amount by 0.02 (2% as a decimal):\n27,600 × 0.02 = $552\n\nStep 5: Subtract the administration fees from the total amount raised to find the final amount raised for the playground:\n27,600 - 552 = $27,048\n\nSo, Tree Elementary School raised a total of $27,048 for the new playground after deducting the 2% administration fees.\"</div></div></td> </tr><tr class=\"group space-x-4 divide-x border-b last:border-none odd:bg-gray-50 hover:cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-100 dark:odd:bg-gray-900 dark:hover:bg-gray-900  focus:bg-gradient-to-b focus:from-blue-100 focus:to-blue-50 focus:odd:bg-white dark:focus:from-blue-900 dark:focus:to-gray-900\" tabindex=\"0\" data-row-idx=\"98\"><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"flan.1551633\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\" dir=\"auto\">\"You are an AI assistant.

You have this beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through you? Can you feel the majesty of the Lord's kingdom and how you're a part of it? Take a moment to kneel and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith and how you feel currently. Think about how you've been responding to God's call and how you've been living in the light of his love. When the priest is ready for you, of course. You'll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it's totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous. He won't treat you any differently either way. Make the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It has been (blank) since my last confession.\" This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that's fine, too. The priest knows what he's doing. The Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you. Once you sit down and you've made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest's lead. He'll ask you how long it's been since your last confession (if you don't voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. It's just a casual conversation! Do not fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you're more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession! This part is intimidating, but think about it this way: the priest you're talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, \"I did so and so,\" will suffice. Your priest is going to be very understanding. If you don't remember the exact timeframe, that's fine. If you don't remember your motivation, that's fine. All your priest cares about is that you're being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place. He'll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, sin and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He's there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this:  My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,I have sinned against You whom I should loveabove all things. I firmly intend, with your help,to do penance, to sin no more, andto avoid whatever leads me to sin.Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.In his name, my God, have mercy  (If you are a Roman Catholic, your act of contrition will go like this: Oh my God, I am very sorry for having offended thee. I detest all of my sins because of thy just punishment. But most of all, because they offend you, my God, who is all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace, to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen. Don't worry! It won't be anything huge. You may even walk away just having to say a few meaningful prayers. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, clean slate to work with. It'll feel so uplifting! Just to clarify, \"absolution\" means your sins are washed away. \"Penance\" is your expression of regret and repentance, showing God that you're truly sorry for what you've done and that you wish for nothing more than to be forgiven.\n\nSummary:\"</div></div></td><td class=\"max-w-sm break-words p-2 group-focus:align-top\"><div class=\"line-clamp-2 group-focus:line-clamp-none\"><div class=\"\"
